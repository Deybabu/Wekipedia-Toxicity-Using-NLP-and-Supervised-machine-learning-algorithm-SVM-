At the age of 11, Marya starred in Belarusfilm movie called “Dunechka”. Soon after she started to play in theatre and was featured in television shows.

She graduated in Spring 2006 and traveled back to Belarus for 2 months. In August 2006 she went to Oceana High School, from which she will graduate in 2010. \\r\\n\\r\\nMarya Dzmitruk is a member of ISAR (International Society for Astrological Research), also a member of a non-profit government organization which deals with human rights abuse throughout the world (also known as Helsinki Committee).

How he broke the Sinn Féin constitution, created fake cumainn to give him fake votes and barred life long republicans from voting.  How he managed to expel himself and his supporters from Sinn Féin membership.  And, how a small band of republicans managed to keep the Sinn Féin constitution and traditional policy in tact. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1986 Section 1b. of the Sinn Féin constitution read as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n“No person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 26-County or 6-County  parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership.\"\" \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Adams leadership put forward a motion, titled Resolution 162, at the 1986 Ard Fheis.  Its wording was as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\nRESOLUTION 162\\r\\n\\r\\nTHAT this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:\\r\\n\\r\\na. Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle.\\r\\n\\r\\nb. Shall not draw their salaries for personal use. (Parliamentary representatives shall be paid a Sinn Fein organiser’s subsidy, and the Leinster House salary shall be divided at the direction of the Ard Chomhairle to defray national and constituency expenses.)\\r\\n\\r\\nTo accommodate this change, the Constitution and Rules be amended as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Section 1b of the Constitution be amended to read:\\r\\n \\r\\nNo person who is a member of any political party organisation or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who, if elected, intend taking part in the proceedings of the Westminster or partitionist 6-County parliaments or who approves of or supports the candidature of persons who sign any form or give any kind of written or verbal undertaking of intention to take their seats in these institutions, shall be admitted to membership or allowed to retain membership. \\r\\n\\r\\nMotion 162 supports and approves of the candidature of persons who, if  elected, would be of the intention to take their seats in certain circumstances i.e. on the direction of the Ard Chomhairle.  Obviously, Motion 162 infringes Section 1b.  Section 1b. was in effect at the time this Resolution was presented.  Its clear that Adams made a mistake in procedure.  He should have sought a majority decision to amend Section 1b. in 1986 and returned in 1987 to propose entering Leinster House.  Trying to amend Section 1b. and propose taking seats in the “partitionist 26-County Parliament” in the same Resolution was a logical impossibility. \\r\\n\\r\\nCan anybody say that  the wording:\\r\\n\\r\\n“That this Ard-Fheis drops its abstentionist attitude to Leinster House. Successful Sinn Fein parliamentary candidates in 26-County elections:\\r\\n\\r\\na.  Shall attend Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle”\\r\\n\\r\\ndoes not constitute the supporting and approving of the candidature of persons who intend to take their seats in Leinster House as directed by the Ard Chomhairle?\\r\\nClearly Adams was in breach of Section 1b. and according to that section he had expelled himself, and all those who voted for Resolution 162.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrian Feeney, in his book, Sinn Féin 100 Turbulent Years, puts forward the argument that Adams had managed to bypass Section 1b, by introducing a motion in 1983 allowing the “discussion” of any aspect of the Sinn Féin constitution.  This change may indeed have facilitated debate on abstentionism but it did not infringe on the content or effect of Section 1b in any way.  To discuss something is not the same as formally proposing or supporting it.  For example, conventions are held regularly where drug addiction is discussed without any of the delegates proposing or supporting it.  In fact the line Adams added in 1983 was superfluous, as the Sinn Féin constitution had never banned the “discussion” of anything – just the “approving” and “supporting” of taking seats in named partitionist parliaments.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course its not illegal to amend or remove section 1b. Section 1b. bans the approval or support of candidates who intend to take seats in British assemblies. It can be removed or amended at any Ard Fheis by a two thirds majority. The reason for doing so could be many. Perhaps delegates might feel that it implies that they cannot be trusted to be loyal to the Republic.

We know about when the generator went off line and we know when they landed. The rest is deduction. What I cannot tell you is if they were down on an island on their belly, (see Lambrechts opinion of landing chances on Gardener) how long they could operate their radios. Or if their electrical system would have been intact enough to function. I grew up in the age of the vacuum tube and know that it would take a minute or two - to \\'warm\\' up the dynamotor and transmitter to the point where it would achieve full power. This is all assuming they had no serious damage to the airplane. My \\'best guess\"\" (OPINION, don\\'t ask me to put it in the article) is that they probably had at least one hour of operation. The other question is how much \"\"gain\"\" they would have gotten from a \"\"less than optimum\"\" (to quote the TIGHAR radio guy) length under 1/8 wave, V-type antenna sitting less than six feet off the ground. The answer is probably - but not definitely - not much. We are looking at an actual output from the antenna of perhaps 10-20 watts with a horizontal polarity and bad angle. Perhaps they were heard. Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range. I find it far easier to think that reports of a \\'weak carrier\"\" or \\'feeble and unintelligible\"\" communications being hear are far more likely than someone who claimed to hear her 4/5.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bottom line - in my humble (and we all know how humble I am) - opinion is that given the best of circumstances, they would have had at least one hour of radio time left if they were out of fuel. \"', 'REDIRECT User talk:Everything counts', 'The real battle started.

However, it was (together with all criticisms) removed/censored by POV pushing editors. No control for mass was done in either experiment, and evaporation of order of less than microgram per second could easily explain the effect (especially in the NASA case); even more so, if there is some moisture. What you are essentially doing, is microwaving the interior of a cone, and - surprise surprise - there is a small force in the opposite direction. Then you turn off the heating, but your interior is still at higher temperature, measure it again, and there is still a force - yet smaller. Nothing to do with exotic physics, everything to do with experimental error due to unforeseen effect of evaporation, i.e. ablation (though some moisture might play an effect, especially if there are parts other than metal; this is, in my opinion, the most likely explanation - EM radiation cannot cause such effect at these power/force ratios (that part was also removed from the article, though all was sourced). So, if there is no some weird effect (and QED effects, virtual plasma included, boil down to EM radiation reaction, there is no violation of impulse conservation there, so that is excluded too), it should be reaction from some loss of mass - and evaporation is an obvious source. However, they did not check for that.

Using your reasoning, we should never be able to oppose on comprehensiveness issues either, because if a consensus of the regular editors of the page says that the article is comprehensive, then it must be. FAC's entire purpose is to try to get a larger perspective on whether the article meets the appropriate policies or guidelines (in other words, consensus can change). I do think that the RCC page suffers sometimes because most of its editors have a very strong POV. That is understandable; people usually work on topics they are passionate about (either for or against). I fully acknowledge (and praise) that they are trying to make the article as NPOV as possible, but when you hold a strong POV sometimes it is hard to recognize where neutral actually is. That is why processes like FAC, GAN, and PR are essential, because then you can get (hopefully) the opinions of people who don't hold a strong POV on the topic. I would encourage you to post at WT:FAC to see what the consensus is for how to review an article - are NPOV and comprehensiveness concerns off-limits?  Or perhaps it would be useful to post at WT:NPOV to see whether there is consensus for your view that NPOV is decided solely by consensus.

There are few ways to explain the meaning and the symbol of Linga.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Linga as Arthabrahma or phenomenal manifestation\\r\\n\\r\\nLinga is the amorphous representation of Shiv and can be regarded as the highest emblem of Shiv because of its least anthrophomorphic nature. Shiv, Parabrahman, is the highest Divine Principle in intimate union with Divine Power, the Parashakti. The only positive qualities of this Divine Principle are Shat, Chit, and Anand. He is conscious of Himself i.e. He has Atmavimarsha. He is the cosmic Purusha (person) but is Nirakar - has no particular form and has no distinguishing mark. He is therefore inconceivable. \"\"God cannot be known by the mind or the physical senses\"\" is consensus of all the sages. It is in this sense Herbert Spensor speaks of God as \"\" Unknown and unknowable.\"\" What he means is that Deity per se is \"\"Unknown and Unknowable.\"\" John Fiasco further argues that \"\"Deity is unknowable to the extent of it is not being manifested to consciousness through the phenomenal world knowable but knowable in order of its phenomenal manifestations: knowable in a symbolic way as the power of being rhythmic life of the universe; knowable as eternal source of moral law.\"\" If we accept this, then Shiv is inconceivable. But if He is not conceived, how can he be worshipped? Yet religious mind craving for eternal happiness cannot be satisfied without worship and cannot do without worship. He, therefore, requires some kind of representation or symbol of God. Without some concrete symbol of God, God would be a formless abstraction devoid of meaning to him/her. Hence it for those, who cannot digest abstract ideas of God, temples are built and images representing Gods in different powers and attributes are consecrated. Whatever may be said against images in the temples, rituals, and ceremonies, the fact remains that they are indispensable at a certain stage of the spiritual evolution life. \\r\\n\\r\\nNirakar Shiv is Amurtha (formless) in his indistinct condition, and is Murtha or Sakar in his manifest condition –manifest in the form of universe. Shiv assumes eight-fold forms and is, therefore, called as Ashtamurthi. Then the Linga represents the whole universe appearing hemispherical placed on something. The Linga, the amorphous symbol of Shiv, thus, represents the Murtha form of Shiv. Hence, the Linga signifies Alinga or Shiv that has no special form or mark. The circular base with round semi-spherical top placed on it fits the description of the idea of Murthavthva.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Linga as Shabdabrahma\\r\\n\\r\\nShivaparabrahman is the cosmic Purusha having Atmavimarsha. He first vibrates in his Leele (play or amusement) towards creation. The vibration is Nada (a loud roar), the first expression as Nama or name. From his Nada proceeds Bindu (dot), i.e. the form. The couplet Nama and Rupa or Nada and Bindu are known as Onkara or Pravana. The Bindu is the disc-like Peetha and Nada is the line that supervenes the Peetha. The line stands on the Bindu like a cylinder with a rounded top. All this forms the Linga.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Linga as the Visvarupa\\r\\n\\r\\nShivaparabrahman has no particular form but is all-formed. He is, therefore, called Visvarupa. He is the creator of the Universe and assumes all forms in the Universe. He is hidden in all creatures, and pervades all and forms inner souls of all. He is said to have a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a thousand feet. He has hands and feet in all directions. The semi-spherical top that supervenes the circular base represents this description of cosmic Purusha, with whom His devotees identify Shiv. The round top on the circular base really consists of thousands of heads, each of the size of a point. The sides of the cylindrical figure represents equally thousands of heads, eyes, and faces in all directions. The semi-spherical top, resembling the visible horizon, is truly symbolical of the universe that surrounds the earth on all sides. Though the symbol has no eyes and feet, or eyes and ears, it has thousands of hands and feet, heads, eyes, and ears in all directions, just as a circle has no face all around but it has faces in all directions at every point of the circumference. Thus the Linga is the closest possible representation of such formless or all-formed God Shiv. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is customary in nature that all classes of things in universe must have different shapes and forms. The so-called \"\"Gods class\"\" must have different shapes and forms, though nobody knows what those shapes and forms should be. It is only the fancy of the human beings that has endowed Gods with some anthrophomorphic forms. But there is no proof of that. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that Gods have shapes and forms different from those of human beings as human beings have shapes and forms different from those of other animals,', \"Omer S.

I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It\\'s probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to \"\"national syndicalism\"\" should facilitate, than oversimplify.\\r\\nRegarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing). It should be borne in mind that the WWII-era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi-fascist Japan formed the \"\"axis\"\", for example, so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me, though ethnocentrism sounds plausible. Just because it sounds plausible, however, does not mean that there are RS describing it as such. Militarism is a common thread, but how does monumental architecture relate to that?

There is a natural delay introduced between the last pulse (or only pulse in the case of the digit \"\"1\"\") being sent and dial reaching its natural position, then an aditional delay before any further can be sent by the user turning the dial clockwise for the next digit.   So the inter-digit pause is comprise of BOTH the last part of the return movement of the dial and the time taken to \"\"wind it up\"\" ready for the next digit.  In fact in many types of P.O. dial mechanism there was also a slight additional pause immediately upon releasing the dial and before the first pulse was sent, due to the design of the mechanism.  In the SxS switches which predominated in the British network, the inter-digit pause had to be long enough to (a) cause the relays in the current stage to recognize that the dialing of the particular digit had finished, and (b) to allow sufficient time for that stage to find a vacant circuit to the next and for that stage to prepare itself ready to receive the next digit.    \\r\\n\\r\\n\"', \"You enjoy picking your nose and then wiping on your math book. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat's disgusting, dude.\", \"Fixing the page \\r\\n\\r\\nThis page needs a lot of work, looking at other Metro Area articles I've seen that San Francisco's is no where near as detailed and that needs to be fixed, it needs to be known as the San Francisco metro Area, for its own MSA and San Francisco Bay Metro Area for its CSA, and the page needs an info box added as well (  )\", \"Hello I am the one known as the vandal person...you may call me kanden7 pf from now on.

I made the comment about the old version of the article almost exactly 3 years ago, see the version at that time: . It said \"\"Einstein–Cartan theory in theoretical physics extends general relativity, to handle spin angular momentum correctly.\"\" at the very beginning and the whole article was written in the spirit of the claim that general relativity (without extensions) describes the spin incorrectly. As far as I can read, this is no longer claimed by the article. Einstein-Cartan theory is a historically important extension of general relativity, with some extra fields (torsion), but all the modern evidence indicates that such extra fields don\\'t exist - and they\\'re not needed. If you care about sociology, no research of cosmology or calculations of NASA\\'s experiments or anything of the sort takes the \"\"torsion field\"\" into account because the latter doesn\\'t exist, as far as the existing evidence - theoretical or experimental - can say. Today, it\\'s not an important proposal to extend GR. The new article doesn\\'t make these points too clear but at least it also no longer makes crazy claims throughout the text that general relativity (without torsion) is inconsistent with the spin, or something like that, so I wouldn\\'t protest against the new version. Visually, it surely looks like a well-written article. However, I see some confusion in your comment that does show that the articles doesn\\'t explain the basic points too clearly. Einstein-Cartan theory is not \"\"just\"\" about the tetrads. Tetrads are indeed useful - and in some formal sense necessary - to describe spin in General Relativity. However, using the tetrads formalism is not yet Einstein-Cartan theory. Einstein-Cartan theory assumes that \"\"torsion\"\" may be nonzero - even though it is identically zero in general relativity (which normally uses the metric). One can write GR in terms of tetrads as well - and the torsion is still zero. If that\\'s so, one isn\\'t doing Einstein-Cartan theory.   \"', \"I find it a bit odd that you are welcoming me as a newbie, I've been here for a while =/\", 'Wikipedia policy \\r\\nIn regulation of wikipedia policy you will give user troy a warning on deleting comments from discussion pages of articles.

To say he \"\"left\"\" the country is non-POV... but the statement added zero value in the first place.  Second, let\\'s talk about some English language usage for all the Ukrainians on here, specifically the difference between literal and figurative language:\\r\\n\\r\\nRevolution:  \"\"A fundamental change in power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time.\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCoup:  \"\"The sudden and illegal seizure of a government, usually instigated by a small group of the existing state establishment to depose the established government and replace it with a new ruling body, civil or military.\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me explain the difference clearly.  A revolution occurs when forces abolish government power structures.  This clearly did not occur.  A coup occurs when one faction of the government seizes control of the existing power structures.  This clearly did occur.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was no revolution in Ukraine.  There was only a coup.  This position is non-POV and sustainable.  I recommend:  \"\"Maidan Coup\"\" or \"\"2014 Ukrainian Coup\"\"... but the term \"\"Ukrainian Revolution\"\" is both POV and misleading.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote:  Above I use the literal definition of \\'Revolution\\' to mean the violent overthrow of government power structures (e.g. the American Revolution).  Revolution also has a figurative definition of \\'wide-ranging change\\' (e.g. the \\'industrial revolution\\').\\r\\n\\r\\n  Applying a figurative term that is not literally true is necessarily POV.  For example, neither the \"\"Velvet Revolution\"\" nor the \"\"Orange Revolution\"\" were literal revolutions and their names are POV and misleading.  In both cases these monikers were coined by dissidents.  I recognize that these are the terms that are widely used to refer to these events and, having become widely recognized, are appropriate titles in Wikipedia.  That does not change the fact that they are POV.  Nor does it change the fact that, in this case, there is no widely recognized name for these events that would justify such POV naming.  I reiterate that the appropriate title is \"\"Maidan Coup\"\" or \"\"2014 Ukrainian Coup\"\"    \"', 'I am from the AACD and posted the information pertaining to the Academy.

I know that Terrorizer is a world-wide known and very well selling magazine, I’m not a kid or crazy guy. I just mean that if they don’t know (or just pretend that don’t know) that Lucifugum is one of the most known East European black metal bands and give them just a half of a sentence of 3 pages they don’t look terribly competent in this subject. Just in this subject, I don’t talk about their whole competence. Don’t you agree?  As for the album a year on own label: Lucifugum is a self-releasing band just last 5 years (of 15 years existence). And it doesn’t make them less notable than they were in past. In interviews they explained their decision to make self-releases. It’s just because of a disappointment in labels which didn’t keep their word and promises (but NOT because of lack of interest to the band). “Vector 33” (the first album of  female fronted Lucifugum) was planned to be released on Drakkar prod., but  Drakkar didn’t release it in due time. That’s why Lucifugum have canceled the deal with Drakkar and released “Vector 33” cd by themselves. It was the first Propaganda cd release. Also in Lucifugum interviews I read that they don’t exclude the cooperation with labels in future if they find a noble label with honest principles. By the way, “Stigma Egoism” on Drakkar prod. is not a re-release, this is the first (and last at the moment) cd edition of this album (Propaganda released just tape version). Also Lucifugum released in 2003 two albums on BlackMetal.Com on cd format (a big independent American label with many releases and good financial might). I mean a critery for musicans, Lucifugum released 3 albums on big indie labels.    \\r\\nP.S. They record an album a year (or almost a year) not just now, in early times they did the same things.

The remaining 10% were caste groups wrongly claiming the Nair status. Moreover, the 1891 census in Kerala was conducted by Iyer Brahmins, who had a deep seated resentment towards Nairs (Iyers were treated much below Illathu Nair and Swaroopathil Nair in Travancore caste system and they were not allowed to perform priestly functions). Since all the original castes composing the Nair supergroup were Kshatriya and none of the historians considered the primary occupation of Nairs anything other than being soldiers, there is no reason to change the introductory phrase. As pointed out in the reference, the Nairs were commonly referred as Kshatriyas (whether it is accurate or not is another question) by historians. KN Panikker, probably the most famous historian from Kerala, calls them \"\"a Dravidian variety of the Aryan Kshatriyas\"\". Chintaman Vinayak Vaidya calls them \"\"Nagara Kshatriyas\"\" in his book  Downfall of Hindu India. The question is not whether the much researched Nagvanshi origin is accurate or not. It is whether Nairs were known as Kshatriya during the last millenium. And the answer is yes, from multiple sources. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever the caste system is the most complex in India, and this is the reason why Swami Vivekananda called Kerala a mental assylum. In Kerala, the son of a King can never be a Kshatriya, as according to Nambuthiri beliefs, a Kshatriya should have a Brahmin father and Kshatriya mother. This is the reason why the so called four \"\"Suryavanshi\"\" dynasties of Kerala always married off their females to Nambuthiris. These clans were known as Samanta Kshatriya and were regarded as equivalent to Kshatriya by the Nambuthiris. It should be noted that the Nambuthiris considered every other caste as Sudra, even the other Brahmin communities. The pollution time period (pula) gives an indication to this. Nambuthiris observed 10 days of pula (6 days in some places). The caste which is immediate next to them, the Samanta Kshatriyas observed 11 days of pula. Top most ranked Ambalavasi Brahmin communities like Elayathu and Moosad (unlike other Ambalavasi Brahmins like Maarar, these two castes were recognized by the Nambuthiris as a part of Brahmin community) observed 12 days of pula. This means that the position of Samanta Kshatriya was intermediate between Nambuthiri Brahmin and Ambalavasi Brahmin. The next higher ranking ones were some insignificant divisions of local Brahmins like Pushpaka Brahmins, who observed a pula ranging from 13 to 15 days. Higher ranking Chandravanshi and Nagvanshi Nair groups (all of the Samantans, most of the Kiryathils and most of Illathils) observed a pula of 15 days. Lower ranking Nairs (like Swaroopathil and Charna Nair) observed a pula of 16 days, so did Iyers and lower ranking Ambalavasis like Maarars in Trivandrum (In Palghat Iyers never observed any pula traditions and were independent on their own). \\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the claim that people were granted the Nair title, I don\\'t think a sufficiently large number of people belonging to other castes were granted the Nair title. A few occurrences are there in Travancore, where during the 18th century a very small number of Iyers were granted the Illath Nair status. During the 18th and 19th century a small number of Vellala and Maravar people were granted Nair status. Other than that there has been absolutely no \"\"conversion of caste\"\". The Portuguese record an incident, during 16th century when a Portuguese captain asked the Cochin King to elevate the status of some lower castes to Nair, the King told him that even the highest ranking Emperor does not have that power. During the end of 19th century, however as the Nair dominance was on a steep decline, a number of servant castes asked the Iyer census takers to count them as Nair, which they happily obeyed. And for a brief period, some of them even added \"\"Nair\"\" or \"\"Pillai\"\" to their surname, until the Kerala government nullified affirmative action benefits to all those who are having such a surname. These groups came not only from the Sudra division, but also from other divisions. These groups included Brahmins like Maarars, GSBs and Pisharodys (In Travancore, where Ambalavasis are having a lower status), Vaishyas like Chettys (in Travancore) and Arya Vaishyas (in Malabar) and even other Kshatriya communities like Marathas and Bunts.   \\r\\n\\r\\n\"', \"hi \\r\\n\\r\\nhi, what is your mom's bra size?\", '\"\\r\\nSorry, you are not a new editor, and you are not cleaning up.- Sinneed \"', 'Thank you for experimenting with the page Virtual LAN on Wikipedia.

Instead of offering a chance for me to bring my article into compliance with Wikipedia standards you quickly deleted it, and by doing so silenced my opinions.  Thats wrong.  And although a comment made by another editor stated that I had a chance to contest the \"\"Speedy Deletion\"\" I could find no such option.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you have notability thresholds for a supposedly public community which rely on mainstream media to set the bar, and the mainstream media is owned and virtually controlled by a few select individuals and organizations with their own agendas, then you have a problem.

I think you are not wholly innocent but I\\'m not convinced that you have been treated with an even hand either.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you may know, I was surprised at and somewhat nonplussed that you and Xandar were blocked.  Heck, the whole straw poll/IAR/block incident is questionable in my book.

This all seems to be \"\"water under the bridge\"\" by now so, rather than reopen old wounds, I would counsel that you learn from the experience and tone down your emotions even if you are being treated unfairly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat said, it\\'s clear to me that there has been a bit of admin myopia seeing incivility on your part while ignoring the same or worse on the part of other editors such as PManderson and others.  I have remarked on this a number of times at Talk:Catholic Church but did not act on it at the time because I was an involved admin.  (I\\'m not an admin anymore so I couldn\\'t act on it now if I wanted to.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs much as I think the current Catholic Church RFC over versions is ill-advised and likely to be inconclusive, it is now underway so I think we should let it run its course.  Once it\\'s done, you might wish to consider a user conduct RFC to raise the fairness issues.  Note that user conduct RFCs are required to be restricted to one specific user.  Thus, you may wish to raise user conduct RFCs on different users such as UberCryxic, PManderson and even SlimVirgin.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m not saying that such user conduct RFCs will get you the satisfaction that you seem to wish.  However, I\\'m just pointing out what recourse you have if you choose to go down that road.  I reserve the right to decide my response to any such RFCs based upon the facts presented at the time.  (How\\'s that for being a weasel?  Sorry.)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there seems to be a consensus that you were treated unfairly, the results of the user RFC could be brought up in various forums such as WP:ANI or WP:ARBCOM.  Based on the history to date, however, you should take into account the fact that it is not a clear-cut case of unfair treatment so the user conduct RFCs could get quite contentious.

The claim \"\"The meetings would have a great influence on the shaping of the modern country of Canada as well as on the Pacific Northwest of the United States\"\" appears in the beginning with a now invalid citation link, which isn\\'t terribly surprising given it was listed in 2006. The issue is the cited material does not back the quoted claim in any fashion and nor does any historical narrative I have read. The diplomatic wrangling between the Americans and British for a few decades was over the Columbia River as a border (or not). Eventually the British agreed to an American proposal for the continuation of the border along 49th the parallel.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere does the PGO fit into this? It stated the 54\\'40 was the northern border despite having no control over any land north of the Columbia River. In 1845 an agreement with the local Hudson\\'s Bay Company was established, with the company \"\"joining\"\" the government. Theoretical control was extended by the PGO, but the majority of the offices for the northern districts were held by the British. I don\\'t see this event holding \"\"great influence\"\" over both Canada and the United States. About the only matter that the PGO was to create that influenced (only America) was the Cayuse War.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what should be done about this exactly?

Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn\\'t know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn\\'t even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it.   \\r\\n\\r\\nSo you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them.

Actually I didn\\'t have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me.

To this end I have taken the liberty of moving your previous reply here.)\\r\\n\\r\\n So if I add a statement that there are no vacuum tubes in SSDs either, you\\'ll insist on a source for that too? \\r\\n\\r\\n Seriously, you are mistaken on a few points. I think you need to read WP:VERIFY yourself: \\r\\n\\r\\n  All material in Wikipedia mainspace, including everything in articles, lists and captions, must be verifiable. All quotations and any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, must include an inline citation that directly supports the material. Any material that needs a source but does not have one may be removed. (emphasis added - jeh) \\r\\n\\r\\n Note the distinction. You wrote \"\"if it can\\'t be verified it gets removed\"\". But, first, the claim that SSDs contain no disks obviously can be verified. Not only is it part of the definition of the term, the very first reference in that very article confirms this claim in its description of these devices. So, no, we don\\'t need to cite a source for this particular instance of the claim. \\r\\n\\r\\n And second, except for BLP issues, WP:V only states that unsourced material that needs a source may be removed. This material didn\\'t need a source, and even if it did, it isn\\'t required to remove it right away. Even for claims that really should have a citation to a WP:RS, the polite and widely accepted thing to do is to add a \"\"citation needed\"\" template. See template:cn. This is a much less abrasive thing to do to someone\\'s edit rather than simply reverting it. \\r\\n\\r\\n I suppose you could say \"\"well, since I removed it, its verifiability has been challenged so now it does require a source.\"\" Yeah, fine. So I go to the work of adding a reference name to one of the refs that\\'s already there, and then cite that same ref from my new text as well. No, it\\'s not much work, but consider: Does it really improve the article to add a reference footnote number to a statement that is as obviously true as this one? Is adding that little footnote number really the best use of my time here? Was it the best use of yours? And will this little challenge you raised over a completely trivial edit and obvious claim make me feel more or less eager to contribute to WP in the future? \\r\\n\\r\\n Also: In my edit I merely noted that despite the term \"\"solid state disk\"\" there are no actual \"\"disks\"\" inside these devices. In your edit comment you said \"\"since they refer to it is a disk we must to [sic]\"\". Well, that is true, but my edit did not remove any reference to the terms \"\"solid state disk\"\" or \"\"electronic disk\"\" from the article, nor even claim that such were wrong. So your edit comment was off point and provided no valid justification for your action. \\r\\n\\r\\n Finally, I must point out that you are wrong about vandalism. The fact is that edits made in good faith are not generally considered vandalism. After reading WP:VERIFY you should probably look at WP:VANDALISM:\\r\\n\\r\\nEven if misguided, willfully against consensus, or disruptive, any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia is not vandalism.

While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.\\r\\n\\r\\nChams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria\\'s population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book \"\"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia\"\", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that \"\"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek\"\" .\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria\\'s muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed', \"This was about your contributions, not you.

Then there is another grouping of Latinate words which came in via the Grammar school boys (Grammar schools of the late medieval being schools which taught latin grammar, and which required students to speak grammar at all times), and the ecclesiastical coinages, from around the same period (late Tudor England onwards). The first lot, the Norman French, had a rather different historical journey from the second lot, the second lot being rather closer to Classical Latin (actually most are Church or Medieval latin, but the difference here is not so great). The Norman French borrowings have a little more fanciness than regular Germanic English because Norman French was the language of the English ruling class (and law etc) for about 300 years. Most the food words come through this path. The second group (borrowed in from about 1400 to 1700) are fancy not so much because they represent the ruling classes, but because they represent learning. Then there's a few other words which come in from other places, like Piano (from Italtian), and others which are similar because they actually come from a common germanic/italic root even a proto-Indo-European root.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think that it would be worth noting the path of derivation (NF vs Lating vs other).\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a second related point, the Germanic in English comes from several dialects, from both the North Germanic group (Norse) and the West Germanic. Old English had a few differing dialects. Northern English dialects tend to have a little more Norse and a little less Anglo-saxon, than the south-east. There are Norse and Saxon cognates which both made it into English, skirt and shirt being the famous examples. So, again some more information regarding the exact derivation of the Germanic, unless someone wants to go the whole hog and put in the proto-Germanic reconstructions.

Even if they would be able to see the same spectrum as us, it remains doubtful if those images will mean anything to them at first glance. However, the point here is to convey information. While we can look at a picture at all wavelengths, it is only in the visible spectrum that information on this picture (patterns and variations) start to appear (at other wavelengths, its blank). An analogy would be satellites using SARs to pierce the cloud cover of Venus and image its surface.   There is little information in the visible spectrum but lots outside of it. If the information is encoded in a digital form (eg: RGB) rather than displayed using our technology, then they will interpret it in colors they can see as this encoding is not relative to a specific spectrum. Still, they should be able to figure out what king of colors we meant to encode in the first place by looking at the probes themselves and the markings on them. I think that the aliens will be able to make sense of this information easily. Regardless, I completely agree with you.

Natural selection, the most important of these, works because some traits or collections of traits will, on average, increase reproductive success, either by protecting the organism from dying before it can reproduce, or by enhancing his reproductive success directly, such as the peacock's plumage. As genes are passed on by reproduction, those that increase reproductive success are more likely to be passed on, relative to neutral or relatively unfavourable traits, and so, generation to generation, the number of organisms with these traits will tend to increase, unless conditions change so as to make them no longer favourable. Other, less important mechanisms of change include gentic drift (random changes in frequency of traits, most important when the traits are, at that time, reproductively neutral), and the founder effect, in which, if a small group of organisms become isolated from the main population, that isolated population will, even many generations on, tend to have a higher frequency of any rare variations in the founders as compared to the original, larger population.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, the accumulation of many of these inherited changes can result in the development of new species from existing ones,  a process called speciation. [Explain major routes of speciation: geographical differences, isolation, divergence into seperate niches, etc]\\r\\n\\r\\n[Simple evidence, probably the Universal genetic code] and other discoveries have shown that this mechanism can be traced back to a single common ancestor, from which all living organisms on Earth descended as a result of cumulative evolutionary change over billions of years, making evolution responsible for the vast diversity of life on Earth, including the many extinct species found in the fossil record.\\r\\n\\r\\n talk\", 'Actually, you are wrong, that would be an example of a false analogy, not a straw man fallacy.

Users in the pinyin section have argued (quite well) that hanyu pinyin should be included in ROC articles because it is used de facto, even in TW. So why then can\\'t we eliminate simplified chinese from the TW related articles as TW\\'s de facto standard is traditional chinese only? Wiki is not a chinese dictionary, so is there any reason to include TW and PRC\\'s writing systems in the articles of the other?

Our only two cites for this section, which claims the argument has been scientifically refuted, which is not true, are a popular science book and a popular science lecture.  Now I'm not disrespecting Kaku or Hawking, but Hawking's statement that there was not time before the universe began is not his, it goes back to Augustine of Hippo, which Hawking says in I believe A Brief History of Time, and so is not in opposition to any basic Christian philosophy about God.  And as I pointed out, physicists and cosmologists do investigate what might have happened before the big bang.  It's not a scientifically meaningless question as this section is trying to claim.  And Kaku's description of the molecules in the jar not being moved, as I pointed out, is not motion from nothing.  The molecules had to have a probability or potential to move.  The reason things can move without another body moving them is they had a probability to move based on the uncertainty principle.  When you ask physicists why a particle just started moving or why for instance the particles are generated in a vacuum, they would say because of the uncertainty principle and the laws of quantum physics.  That's implying a cause.  There was a cause for the motion or the creation, not something out of nothing.  Now laws of physics and probabilities are not nothing.  And where did they come from?  Hawking I believe in a actual paper he wrote had the universe jumpstarted from a primeordial wave function, see Hartle-Hawking state, but where did that come from?  And this idea, as most ideas about the initial conditions of the universe, has been in no way accepted by all or even most scientists.  So unless it can be shown from a credible cited source that the vast majority of physicists and cosmologists hold that the cosmological argument has actually been scientifically refuted, not that they just don't personally accept it or something like that, we should not be making that claim.  For instance the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy makes no such claim, and has several pros and cons for the argument based on modern science, including the example of vacuum motion and vacuum genesis.  And as for popular science sources, Carl Sagan always held that the idea of a creator and generator of the universe had neither been proven nor disproven by science.\", 'PICTURE \\r\\n\\r\\nThat photo of him makes him look extremely gay.

Criticism does not put undo weight on negatives. Again the purpose of the article is not to argue the point of progressivism but to report the facts.\\r\\n4.  The fact is criticism exists and it should be reported.  The criticism section included an AUthor and his book.\\r\\n5.

He claims, dispite contradictory evidence and no evidence of his own that classical liberals have nothing in common with libertarians.  That classical liberals are not inheritors of liberalism.  and that modern liberals do not have a different understanding of liberalism than 200 years ago.  Furthermore, he makes the original research pov claim that classical liberals are more like elitist Republicans than libertarians (for which he has NO CITATION, and this is one of the grounds for the deletions).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is just another example of the abuse some wiki editors will make up in order to push their own agenda.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe logic is poor.

Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2007.  An ethnographic film by indigenous creators can also concentrate heavily on a particular movement towards indigenous activism.  The way an activist approach is accomplished is when filmmakers approach the issue with a tactic of openness, which ultimately no longer makes the camera a transparent object and instead an actor on stage that is allowed to be lead by its subjects.Aufderheide, Patricia.

You had corrected the name \"\"Stadtzeitung\"\" we have in note #4 of this article into \"\"Stattzeitung\"\", because only the latter was verifiable, you said. Then, by chance, somebody found out the link to the \"\"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg\"\" and the erroneous correction could be reverted. Notice that if there had been no documentation of the \"\"Stadtzeitung für Freiburg\"\" online, but only, say, in a press archive in Freiburg, or if nobody had made the effort to verify the verifiability, the error would not have been detected, and the \"\"truth\"\" would now be, erroneously, \"\"Stattzeitung\"\". A beautiful mistake, by the way, very evangelical, being of the same sort as those we can find in the manuscripts of the Gospel.   ;-)\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let us apply this to another case, take Anton van Hooff, who is in charge to turn King\\'s evidence for \"\"pseudo-science\"\", \"\"severe methodological flaws\"\" and \"\"factual errors\"\". Of course, he has written this, among several name-callings, so this is verifiable. But can we take it seriously? If we look closer we see that the first accusation of van Hooff towards Carotta was to not have taken into account the well known Tacitus-passage about Nero and the \"\"christians\"\". But since Carotta had treated it in detail, van Hooff was exposed, because he had shown that he had attacked a book without having read it, so that he himself was convicted of the \"\"severe methodological flaws\"\" and \"\"factual errors\"\" he tried to impute to other people. The subsequent escalation with the accusation of \"\"pseudo-science\"\" was only his embarrassing attempt to divert from the lack of professionality he had shown. This, too, can be verified. The question is then: Which verification is relevant?\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Hooff is refered to as a \"\"Senior lecturer of Ancient History and Teacher Trainer for Classics at Nijmegen University, the Netherlands\"\" in the link given in note #17. But we see that at the University of Sofia he is also called \"\"Professor Associate\"\". Looking on the Internet we can verify that he is called a \"\"professor\"\" on several websites. Looking closer we can also verify that he was never a professor, and is by now a teacher in a secondary school, as he himself stated in a newspaper article. So what have we truly verified? That he is a confidence trickster who let himself be called a professor without actually being one, in order to improve his authority as an alleged important scholar? If we look to the list of publications he is giving there, we see that he is speaking of \"\"numerous books and articles\"\" but specifies only one title. Modesty or showing-off?\\r\\n\\r\\nVan Hooff being a notorious polemicist, can his accusations be taken seriously? Nobody does it in The Netherlands (why is there no article about him in the Dutch WP? – The only Antoon van Hooff listed there is a zoo director, who was ashamed of the homonymy), but he is taken seriously here, in the English WP where most \"\"judges\"\" do not even understand Dutch. Why? Because it is so stated in the German WP already? If we take a look at the history there, we can verify that somebody had first put the article in the category \"\"Pseudowissenschaft\"\" (pseudo-science), but then, this being not allowed because libelous, they \"\"discovered\"\" \"\"Van Hooff\"\", taking him as \"\"proof\"\", without examining his credibility, happy to have the possibility to maintain their libelous allegation in an appearance of legality: it is \"\"only\"\" a quotation! ;-)\\r\\n\\r\\nSo much about verifiability and truth.

It appears to be remnants of longer pieces of information standing in isolation. If anyone can work out there are two trials now in progress one which started in September 2012 at the Delhi Patiala Court heard by Mr Justice Akash Jain based on a FIR filed by the Delhi Police due to her fasting at the Delhi Jantar Mantar 6 October 2006. That trial has now completed two full days of hearings the next production warrant the 14th is set for October 30-31 2014 2 days of prosecution witnesses.\\r\\nThe second trial is in Imphal. So after her arrest on fresh charges March 2014 the Imphal Police pressed charges at that point a local corrupt lawyer turned up and decided that the best thing was for all charges to be dropped and Sharmila to be placed in a death tent where he desire to starve herself to death over a few weeks could be respected. The Chief Judicial Magistrate rejected his plea to dismiss all charges after 13 years of imprisonment because someone might ask why did you imprison her then and keep her in solitary if there was no case to answer. The lawyer then appealed to higher Court the District & Sessions Judge. When this Judge looked at the case he pointed out the prosecution hadn't actually submitted any evidence of any wrong doing other than suggesting that everybody knew she was on a fast to death. Given that following procedural rules of evidence in court no evidence was actually being presented just references to hearsay the Judge ruled that in the absence of positive evidence to suggest mens rea he didn't need to look into the validity of the actus reus of whether hunger striking was grounds for arrest under the attempted suicide legislation so he dismissed the charges adding that he felt the Government should take measures to preserve Sharmila's health because even if hte Prosecution hadn't bothered to present any evidence he knew she was on a hunger strike and would die without farther intervention. Subsequently the Government re-arrested Sharmila on a fresh charge of attempted suicide and appealed to the Manipur High Court to have the District & Sessions Judge's judgement overturned and for a trial to proceed. Meanwhile Sharmila is held at the JNIMS security ward (not house arrest because then she would be in her own home) on 15 day judicial remand. The last judicial remand renewal was 5th September (the next one is due on 19th September) the last hearing of the Manipur High Court regarding the judicial review of the previous case dismissal was 3 September when they sought more papers but it appears this is all to complicated for wiki editors so they have gone with what appear to be verifiable facts in no particular order which when read do not make any sense at all.

Royce Mathew had made a short derivative video work in 1994.  Royce Mathew’s credits included projects for Paramount Pictures, Allan Carr, David DeCoteau and Charles Band and his Full Moon Entertainment company.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen years later, as the lawsuit details, via Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, the Walt Disney Company, had incorporated various homages from their Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride attraction into Royce Mathew’s supernatural pirate story, and are selling it as Walt Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl movie franchise.   The Walt Disney Company states that Royce Mathew’s claims and lawsuits have no merit.  \\r\\n\\r\\nDuring legal proceedings,  the Walt Disney Company, Jerry Bruckheimer (films/Inc.), Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio “The Defendants” were all represented by the same team of attorneys headed by Sanford “Sandy” Litvack, who is a close associate of the Walt Disney Company (Michael Eisner), who also was the Walt Disney Company’s attorney in the noted lawsuit of Jeffrey Katzenberg vs the Walt Disney Company.\", '\"\\r\\nPlease, spare us the \"\"Poles and Jews\"\" game.

Many of them are simply not aware that prior to being named yadav they were registered as Ahir in british census. so, instead of bringing yadava rulers of the past they need to show Ahir Yadava connection.

There is a very long gap between Yadavas of mythical era and those historians have traced so this would always be a matter of debate, and this has nothing to do with the arrival date of Abhira, because most of Hindu scriptures including Mahabharata has been written between 6th and 8th century AD, and are suspected to be backward projection. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne important fact regarding Yadavas is that, though it means descent from Yadu, actually it means claiming Krishna lineage. Cult of krishna has no eveidence of existence before the beginning of the Christian era. so, dynasties had actually two kinds of claim, one from Krishna the God of Abhira, and another from Krishna the hero of Mahabharata. Again those who have adopted Krishna of Mahabharata did so only after it was written. These people are suspected to have styled on that line. There are Scholars(Check Rusell,B.V.) who believe Krishna of mahabharata is actually a cunning cruft of Brahmanas,and episodes related to him in Mahabharata are actually later days interpolations, done after stealing the god and philosophy of abhira tribe.

In your initial message to me, given at the time when you reverted all of the work I had done, you called my efforts vandalism and nonsense; I realize this is probably a auto-generated message sent in response to a flagged *accidental* event, but given that I\\'ve made several attempts to communicate to you, via this page as well as four or five times thru the original \"\"vandalism/nonsense\"\" (to which to you responded *once*, with, I might add, a tone that was less than in keeping with the tone I see when I read the messages on this page).  Nevertheless, what I was trying to accomplish with the Moline page was to take a wikipedia entry that was woefully lacking and add some real value to it  I had added the the Moline page a \"\"location\"\", \"\"air travel\"\", \"\"major interstate highways\"\", \"\"sports\"\", \"\"gambling\"\", and \"\"landmarks; and notable bridges\"\" sections.  Additionally, I completely revamped the schools section into an \"\"education\"\" section that provided internal and external links to every school mentioned.  You removed all of that.  BTW, I tried to document all of my efforts in the Discussion page, so anyone could see what I was trying to do: make the Moline page better.  Before I found it, it was little more than a glorified rundown of which neighborhood has more Mexicans than the next... and I found it simply too racist to let stand.  Yes, I also was trying to edit the Neighborhood section, to remove the racism, but also better demonstrate the real flavor and history of the town.  Thanks to you, the history and flavor is gone, and the racism is back...  Congratulations.  A final request; if you see fit to keep my efforts out of the wiki, then please be so kind as to be consistent, for I still see the results of my writing on the Moline page.  IF you are going to remove my work and have the Moline page reflect the rants of one racist hick, please be consistent and completely remove all of my work - either keep all of my work in... or none of it.

Yield burning by brokerage firms jeopardized the tax-exempt status of interest paid to holders of those bonds.The multi-million dollar settlement resolved the civil fraud charges under the False Claims Act against Raymond James. The payments made by Raymond James will also resolve certain tax-related claims of the Internal Revenue Service.http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2000-45.txt\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, Raymond James was paid $650,000 to undertake the merger of HomeGold with smaller firms.

I'm not sure of the exact definition in the past, but it pre-dates railways by several centuries.  'Battle stations' as a term dates back some considerable way, and naval vessels in their correct patrol areas were said to be 'on station' in Nelson's time.  I believe it is derived from a Latin word meaning 'still' (i.e. 'stationary').  'Railway station' as a term goes back at least as far as 1825, while 'train station' was not recorded for over a century after that, nor were 'petrol station', 'power station' or 'bus station'.  One important consideration is how widespread a term is.  Is it a 'railway station' in Australia, India, South Africa or any other country where the British built the railways?  Finally, the term 'train' may be incorrect when referring to modern passenger railway vehicles.  Under some definitions, trains are exclusively loco-hauled or push-pull.  Most modern passenger vehicles are multiple units, and thus not 'trains' under these definitions, because there is no locomotive.\", 'Hardly possible now that some other editor got his panties in a wad and refused to engage in a discussion.

Furthermore, very likely the vast majority of established editors are fully aware of who Giano is - and his previous accounts.

Best regards.  \"', \"Jesse Ragan deletion nomination\\r\\nHi, I have received notice that the page I began about Jesse Ragan has been nominated for deletion based upon suspicion it is a vanity article. First, I am not the man (assuming Jesse ragan is male), nor have I met him/her. I began the article because as a professor of typography I felt Ragan's work significant, and that s/he had achieved work of lasting merit fairly early in life. S/he has been several time recognized by the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) (the national professional organization for graphic designers), Ragan's work has appeared in respected design periodicals, and has lectured on typography at several Association of Independent Colleges of Art and Design (AICAD) institutions. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral days ago I noticed removal of Ragan's name from credits for typefaces on the Tobias Frere-Jones article. My first thought was that some disagrement might have occured between Ragan and his former employers Hoefler & Frere-Jones, perhaps leading to a nomination for deletion. Mr. Hoefler wrote to me publicly on my talk page that Jesse Ragan was only one of many who worked on the project. That may be the case, but that would not discredit typefaces Ragan has produced entirely on his own, or the two mentions of his contributions to the Archer typeface on the AIGA web site. Clearly, at some point someone at Hoefler & Frere-Jones thought Ragan's contributions significant enough to provide his/her name (and not the rest of that team) to our national professional organization. The fact that Mr./Ms. Ragan is now independent and a competitor to other type foundries might be a part of this. But I have no knowledge of this. I know none of these people personally, and I respect the work of all of them as a review of my edit history will suggest. My primary reason for beginning the article was to increase the number of articles on typeface designers, and a secondary desire to increase the number of typography related articles in general. Jesse Ragan's work is very solid, even his/her own direct client list is impressive. In the world of typography, apprentices are historically given credit, witness Francesco Griffo who apprenticed to Aldus Manutius. It is my hope that Wikipedia will continue to make some room for subjects that though not block buster in scale are significant.\", \"Okay.

Why would you dare to remove Wolfram Schurig, co-editor of the primary book series focused on the New Complexity, leader of the bludenzer tage in its most daring period, and composer commissioned by leading ensembles throughout Europe?  If you don\\'t know anything about him, this reflects badly on your claim to be an expert in this field.  Why would you remove Klaus K. Hübler, whose influence on New Complexity composers is clearly stated in multiple articles in the New Music and Aesthetics in the 21st Century series. Marc André has received numerous prestigious awards and commissions, and his work has also been closely associated with New Complexity; one need only read his articles appearing in the New Music and Aesthetics series to find support for this assertion.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would strongly suggest that you do your homework in this field before you go about arbitrarily altering the contributions of others.  You could begin by going through the first six volumes of the New Music and Aesthetics series, then read numerous articles in Musik & Âsthetik (several references that appeared earlier in this entry have been removed) and works by Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf and others.  Then visit several dozen festival in Europe over an extended period.

However, a force need not be \"\"perceived\"\" to exist. The definition of \"\"acceleration\"\" is indeed confusing to the lay person, but I think that the wikilink on acceleration covers it. We need to be careful to not go overboard in description in the lead.\\r\\nProvide definition: \"\"momentum (quantity of motion)\"\"\\r\\nHmm, this isn\\'t exactly an accurate definition of momentum since momentum is, in fact, both mass and motion. Again, the wikilink I think should suffice, but maybe we can reword things without providing definitions to make it clearer. I want this to be intelligible, but I\\'m afraid that including these points might be confusing for many and an annoyance to even more.\\r\\nFollowing the development of quantum mechanics, it is now understood that momentum is a fundamental property of particles and that, according to the standard model of particle physics, changes in momentum are the consequence of the net emission or absorption by particles of momentum-carrying gauge bosons. Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a \"\"force\"\" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions. In modern physics, only four fundamental interactions are known; in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational.[1] High-energy particle physics observations in 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a unified electroweak interaction. No gauge boson has yet been demonstrated for mediating the gravitational interaction and what is perceived as the \"\"force\"\" of gravity is more accurately attributable to the the effect of distortions by massive bodies of the curvature of spacetime as explicated in Einstein\\'s Theory of General Relativity.\\r\\nThere is a slight issue here with the sentence: \"\"Effects which are at the macro level experienced as a \"\"force\"\" are the consequence of the aggregate effect of these boson-mediated fundamental interactions.\"\" This sentence misses the fact that forces also exist on the micro level. A single boson-mediated fundamental interaction often has a \"\"force\"\" associated with it. For example, an electron accelerates because it emits a photon: this is due to the electromagnetic force acting on the electron. One micro-interaction: still a force since a mass accelerated.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will implement the wording I think is good, but let\\'s keep discussing the problematic wording.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"', 'Leftcoastman \\r\\n\\r\\nProud of your block?

The original \"\"Land Of Confusion\"\" song/video were in existence for 2 decades before Disturbed decided to cover it.  Adding such an overwhelming amount of info on Disturbed\\'s cover version distorted readers\\' analysis of the original song/video. (For what it\\'s worth, I personally don\\'t even care for Genesis at all, nor do I have any special fondness for this song/ video, though the video\\'s puppetry was fairly innovative in its day.)  But I & others felt the article was being pillaged by Disturbed fans, and thus Wikipedia was being compromised in the process.  The article is much more fairly balanced now, and gives appropriate coverage to Disturbed\\'s version.  So I have no regrets about how I edited it, nor do I have a problem with what you added back, since I think you added back a judicious amount... though the huge Infobox is pushing things a bit. (I only made that one edit to the article & had forgotten all about it until just now.) As user Robotman1974 posted back on Jan. 16th, \"\"Right now the word counts of the main parts of the Genesis version vs the Disturbed version are 775 to 996 respectively.\"\"  So you see, the word count (showing clear bias in favor of Disturbed\\'s version over the original version) is what motivated my pruning.  I do welcome your further thoughts on this, though, since I realize Disturbed probably spent a lot of time and money on making that video, & they are a bit more highbrow than most \"\"nu-metal\"\" bands of today. And I agree with you that their cover version is more notable than most, since theirs did very well on the charts (though I never even knew theirs existed until I stumbled onto this article).  The only recourse that would make both sides happy is to make an entire new article devoted to Disturbed\\'s version. I would be in favor of that; this would allow you to add back all the info I deleted initially.\\r\\n\\r\\nBest, and good luck in the governor\\'s race,\\r\\n\\r\\n 06:30, 3 May\"', \"And if disagreeing with you means I'm corrupt, I really don't see how it's possible to have a constructive debate of anything.

My suggestion for a succinct description of Cox would be \"\"Independent Catholic bishop\"\", as that is how his church is described.   \"', '\"\\r\\n\\r\\n the opening insult made to me \\r\\n\\r\\n\"\"The above rant\"\" was an insult that was made to me. Before I made insults back. Why isn\\'t this user blocked? Please answer this question.  \"', '\"\\r\\nFirst, I would observe that there was a nearly unanimous consensus in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winzapper to retain the article.  Every established user who commented at the AFD besides you supported retention of the article.  Under such circumstances, the AFD discussion would almost certainly have been closed as \"\"keep\"\" regardless of who closed it. I doubt that there would be many administrators willing to delete an article as a result of an AFD discussion in which many established users supported retention of the article, and not one established user besides the nominator supported deletion, unless the article constituted a serious WP:BLP violation, a copyright violation, or was otherwise exceptionally harmful, or there was clear evidence that comments favoring retention were the result of canvassing, abusive sockpuppetry, or other unacceptable activity.  Why?  Simply put, the strengths of arguments offered at AFD discussions do not exist as absolute quantities which are not subject to any reasonable dispute.  Instead, the perceived strength of arguments varies as a function of the person evaluating them.  So, an administrator who decided to delete an article in the face of essentially unanimous support of established users for retaining it would be putting himself in the position of claiming that his personal judgment regarding the merits of the arguments presented was so far superior to the judgment of every other established user who expressed an opinion at the AFD that his personal opinion properly outweighed nearly all others.  An administrator might properly advance such a claim only in rather exceptional circumstances, which were not present here.  This is not to say, however, that AFD discussions are decided purely by counting the votes of established users: they clearly are not.  Rather, the applicability of the principle that AFD is not a vote is subject to limitations, which are most clearly reached when there is absolutely no support by anyone except the nominator for the deletion of an article.  Administrators have been known, on occasion, to delete articles as a result of AFD discussions in which a clear majority of established users supported retention of the article, if they personally believe the arguments for deletion to be more firmly supported by Wikipedia policy or otherwise more persuasive; even in such cases, however, they generally require some substantial support for the deletion of an article before deleting it (though the supporters of deletion may be distinctly in the minority).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a corollary to the principle that administrators quite rarely delete articles against a nearly unanimous consensus for retention at AFD, it is quite rarely the case that there would be a nearly unanimous consensus for the retention of an article that was in clear violation of Wikipedia policy or otherwise clearly needed to be deleted.  While it is true that Wikipedia\\'s verifiability and notability policies require that articles concern topics of which there is significant coverage in multiple third-party reliable sources, and while the presence of such sources in the article itself at the time of the AFD provides the clearest possible evidence of notability, there is no support, in either Wikipedia policy or practice, for the contention that any article which comes to AFD without the necessary sources to establish its notability, and to which no such sources are added during the AFD discussion, must therefore automatically be deleted.  Rather, where it is reasonably believed that the sources necessary to establish notability are likely to exist, the  community may choose to retain the article, even if such sources are not present at the time of the AFD.  So, if someone were to nominate, say, our article on the National Electrical Code for deletion on the grounds of inadequate sourcing and failure to establish notability, the article would properly be retained, even if sufficient sources weren\\'t produced during the AFD discussion.  Often, the belief that acceptable sources can be found for an article is little more than subjective opinion.  Consequently, arguments of the form \"\"keep, I believe this subject is notable\"\" are valid at AFD, if a sufficient number of established users assert them.  \"', 'Now I know what the money that I have contributed to wikipedia has really been used for.

I want it to be known that I hold no grudge against FayssalF but feel that for the best interests of the overall project that I have to bring this request here. As this involves one of your own, I know there is going to be a desire to write off anything I may have to say, and possibly use the filing of this report against myself in another report I will be filing and directly related to this. I do hope that members of ARBCOM can view this without bias.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was blocked by User:Moreschi due to alleged harrassment of another editor. What brought this accusation of harrassment up was due to:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Serious_ban_request\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter a two week block which I received (and will be addressing separately), Fayssal proceeded to do a check-user on myself and User:Miyokan which he announced here:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Russavia.2C_confirmed_sock_of_Miyokan.3F\\r\\n\\r\\nAn admin, User:Tiptoety then proceeded to indef block both myself and Miyokan on case of being sockpuppets (Miyokan as being one of my socks).\\r\\n\\r\\nI attempted to have this sockpuppet block removed on account of providing my IP address in an open fora, so that editors/admins could see that I was in Perth (Western Australia), whereas Miyokan was in Nizhniy Novgorod (Russia). These attempts were denied due to the check-user that had been performed by Fayssal. A check-user which he himself confirmed the results of in that thread above. I proceeded to send an email to Miyokan (for only the 3rd time that I can remember we have ever had a direct discussion) in order to talk to him about this. In the meantime, Fayssal had posted a message to my talk page which in effect stated that Miyokan being in Nizhniy Novgorod is not the case, and that I should know this as both Russavia and Miyokan are in Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen discussing with Miyokan not long after I sent the email, I found out that he was in fact located not in Nizhniy Novgorod, but in Adelaide (South Australia). After that, I then became aware of the message Fayssal left on my TP; and I responded to the effect that the results of the check-user should be revealed, as I know I am in Perth, and I know that Miyokan is in Adelaide (but did not mention Miyokan\\'s location due to privacy).\\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily, and thankfully, I was able to convince Miyokan to place his IP on his talk page, with a note to say it is for my use. I then posted both IPs on my talk page, and provided the relevant links to check them (www.network-tools.com and www.geohacks.com) and that would reveal that we are not in the same location, and hence not the same user.\\r\\n\\r\\nFayssal said that he tried but was getting timeout messages and would look again. Whilst all of this is happening, discussions is still going on at the Admin noticeboard, and nothing short of Wikimurder was going on - a fact I pointed out to Fayssal at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\nEventually Fayssal came back and confirmed that what was being said all along my myself was in fact the truth. He placed a notice on my talk page with an apology. This and my response can be found at:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Russavia#Unblocked_and_apologies\\r\\n\\r\\nI responded to this stating that the apology would be wholeheartedly accepted once a similar apology was made to Miyokan, as the community has already dealt with his previous use of two accounts - which stopped immediately when he was alerted to it being a no-no. And I stand by the comments there. And yes, I am still willing to accept the apology so long as Miyokan also receives the same apology, as both of our accounts were unneedlessly dragged thru the mud, and if the accusation can be made jointly, then so should the apology.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s the background. Now here\\'s the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat has occurred here is a total breakdown in admins doing check-users or the check-user system itself is horribly flawed and needs to fixed. This does not take into account our totally different style, completely different editing subjects, with little or no interaction, etc - this episode should be directly mentioned at WP:DUCK as a prime example as to why WP:DUCK is inherrently flawed.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider this one question. If I was not able to convince Miyokan to reveal his IP, where would we be at now? That is the question that needs to be considered in conjunction with the fact that a Geo-IP check is a simple operation, an internet novice is able to do it.

I have tried to have this discussed in a responsible way on her Talk page but she has outrageously deleted all the critiques I have posted there. In my view, Gwen Gale's actions and judgement are seriously called into question by her conduct apparent in this thread and subsequent attempts to discuss it. I will post the text of the complaint I made below. If you agree that she has acted improperly, please respond saying so. Two people of this opinion (one other) are required before a Request for Comment on her actions can be made.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a complaint relating to the conduct of Administrator Gwen Gale with specific reference to her summary deletion of the section labelled “Criticism” in the Alex Jones Talk Show Host page on 15 March 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nHer most substantive comments relating to the summary deletion were as follows  \\r\\n“single source cited says it's not clear what even happened”\\r\\nI've removed it following WP:BLP and WP:WEIGHT, given the single cited source says it's not even clear what happened, it's nothing but a non-notable, second-hand anecdote about what may or may not have been a parking lot brawl. Gwen Gale (talk) \\r\\nThe grounds (as you put it) are WP:BLP. Gwen Gale (talk)  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe complaint is based on five points \\r\\n1/ Gwen Gale failed to follow proper policy with regard to deleting biographical material on living persons, viz. discussing it beforehand. The section had existed for some time, had been discussed and commented on extensively, and had been edited by several persons. As far as I am aware, Gwen Gale had no prior involvement in the page or the section concerned. Certainly, I had never seen her name in any of the page history. Unless it constituted a grave breach of some other policy, which not even Gwen Gale has claimed, any possible deletion should have been discussed beforehand and not executed summarily. To quote the BLP policy  “Biographical material about a living individual that is not compliant with this policy should be improved and rectified; if this is not possible, then it should be removed.”\\r\\nNo complaint about the nature of the material was made beforehand; no opportunity for improvement or rectification was offered. \\r\\n2/ Having failed to discuss it properly beforehand, Gwen Gale also failed to discuss it properly afterwards. She made a few general remarks, using terms which, as will be discussed later, do not form part of any Wikipedia policy, viz. “single sourced, anecdotal”, and breezily referred those who wanted to discuss the matter with her to general Wikipedia policy documents, such as Biography of Living Persons or Verifiability. As will be shown in what follows the text did not violate either of these policy documents. Gwen Gale refused multiple specific requests to quote the exact passages of the Biography on Living Persons or Verifiability policies which she claimed had been violated. This refusal to properly discuss a summary deletion is against Wikipedia conduct guidelines and not acceptable behaviour in an Administator.\\r\\n3/ Gwen Gale’s comments on the summary deletion reveal that she does not understand the core Wikipedia policy on reliable sources.\\r\\n4/ Gwen Gale’s comments indicate that she does not understand the proper scope of Wikipedia’s policy on Verifiability.\\r\\n5/ Gwen Gale’s comments reveal that she does not understand Wikipedia’s Biography on Living Persons policy. \\r\\nThe only serious grounds on which deletion of the deleted text could be justified is Weight. This is not the ground on which Gwen Gale chose to defend it. She repeatedly cited BLP and V as the core defence of her actions, demonstrating that her judgement is massively flawed and that her administrative powers should be revoked. The core issue here is not the content. The core issue is Gwen Gale’s conduct and judgement. The Weight issue will, however, be discussed at the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nGwen Gale’s Misunderstanding of the Wikipedia’s Guidelines on Reliable Sourcing\\r\\nIt is clear that Gwen Gale does not understand Wikipedia’s policy on sourcing. In stating that the claims embodied in the deleted text were “anecdotal”, she is effectively second-guessing the judgement of the original reliable source, viz. The Austin Chronicle. She is implicitly expressing the view that the Austin Chronicle’s assembled journalists, editors, sub-editors and lawyers made an error in judgement in publishing the article in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and represents a FUNDAMENTAL ERROR IN JUDGEMENT. It is in no way appropriate for Wikipedia editors to make their own subjective judgements about the editorial standards of highly reputable and professional publications. It is the equivalent of an editor disputing a reference to a professional academic journal on\", '\"\\r\\n\\r\\n Please do not add inappropriate external links, as you did with this edit to KMCA-LP.

It is easy to see that \"\"chamets\"\" corresponds to the Arabic root ḥ-m-ḍ, because the Aramaic version (which appears in the Aramaic parts of the Hagada) is ḥamiʕa (with `Ayin), and almost all Arabic \"\"Ḍads\"\" map to `Ayin in Aramaic. In Hebrew, the root means both \"\"sour\"\" and \"\"leavened\"\" (cf. \"\"chamuts\"\" =sour; \"\"chomets\"\" =vinegar; \"\"chumtza\"\" =acid). In Arabic it is used mostly to denote \"\"sour\"\" or \"\"acidic\"\". In any event, \"\"chamets\"\" is not related to \"\"hummus\"\" or \"\"Homs\"\". \"\"Hummus\"\" is \"\"chimtza\"\" in Modern Hebrew, and in one case, \"\"chometz\"\" in the Bible might be \"\"hummus\"\" rather than vinegar, but the root is historically different, and only accidentally did they assume the same phonetic shape.   \"', '\"Hello, Ruleoflawlawyer, and welcome to Wikipedia!

And, contrary to Khanassassin\\'s  assertion that no reviews were overly positive, these two happened to be extremely so, with very little, if any, negative criticism.  There were actually quite a few \"\"raves\"\" for the album, and  I gave extra weight to Rolling Stone because it is a magazine often cited by Dan56, who\\'s edting was serving as my model,  and because Rolling Stone did not base their response on Minaj\\'s \"\"rejection\"\" of hip hop, as some in the hip hop community see her actions.  Being a more rock-base source, the review seemed quite nuanced and even-handed, while many of the hip-hop oriented magazines seemed annoyed with her \"\"pop\"\" side.\\r\\n  \"', 'eat shit, fucko \\r\\n\\r\\nsuck my asshole, then die, horribly\\r\\nI hope you get cancer', \"I don't give a flying fuck about wiki and I am sure telling you that will get another of your petty bans.

Could you take a look at this page? It seems a little suspicious to me...no references and the only google hits to the 18-ethoxycoronaridine are to the wiki page and the website of the abovementioned Obiter Research (some other ethoxy coronaridine derivatives are found as natural products, but not the 18-). I\\'m thinking if the University of Vermont had licensed out one of their patented compounds for the development of a new drug addiction treatment medication (the patents on 18-methoxycoronaridine are rather broad so this probably is covered) then they would have made some kind of press release about it?   \\r\\nThe compound doesn\\'t show up in SciFinder, but it\\'s not too surprising that nothing has been published yet if it was first synthesized in 2010.  It\\'s quite possible that little is known about it, and it would be too early to be considered a drug addiction treatment, and not yet something to put out a press release about.  So the content of the article doesn\\'t come across as inaccurate to me, but it probably doesn\\'t meet Wikipedia\\'s guidelines pertaining to notability and verifiability.  My guess is that someone involved in the research created the article in a moment of vanity.  It might be best to merge the article into another which already has content about various coronaridine derivatives, such as 18-Methoxycoronaridine.  This would at least put it in context.    (Edgar181) \\r\\nHmm fair points, I was thinking about just asking the page creator for the relevant patent number so the page at least has a reference. But now that I had a better look I\\'m still more suspicious about the company, they look like they are just doing a custom synthesis of an obscure material that people might want and trying to sell it for a high price (18-methoxycoronaridine is not readily available from biosciences suppliers like Tocris or Sigma-Aldrich so researchers would probably be interested in a close analogue). And if things like this are anything to go by I feel the page may be more about marketing their poor quality product (they even admit it is racemic on their webshop) than proclaiming their new research. I\\'d be tempted to email the University of Vermont (or maybe just Dr Glick personally as no doubt he would know) about whether any licensing agreement exists as claimed.   \\r\\nOk the relevant patent is US 6211360 issued to Stanley D Glick and Martin E Kuehne and the University of Vermont in 2001, but the patent filing was in 1996. So the 18-ethoxy compound is covered by the patent but it isn\\'t one of the examples or preferred compounds', 'Most of your edits in Antisemitism have been reverted by Roscelese \\r\\n\\r\\nRoscelese reverted your edits on Antisemitism.

For someone who is not German this may not be clear, but the first paragraph states intentions, not facts. In Germany there are still people who physically hurt other people and (very few) state authorities who do not act against this, so I believe using is may be confusing. If you want to do a literal translation, the upper version is closer to the original, while the press office version is closer to the meaning.  \\r\\n\\r\\n Diverse errors and unencelopedic context use \\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to ask this whole article to be checked through. While most of it seems all right, there are passages that make no sense, lack imporatant information or are plain wrong. Examples: First paragraph of Drafting process is\\r\\nThe outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Germany cost humanity approximately 62 million people, or 2.5% of the world population. About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, genocide (in particular, the Holocaust), massacres; and aerial bombing.\\r\\nWhile the numbers may or may not be correct, what is the purpose of this paragraph? The people who died and especially the people who did not die because of the war but because of the Holocaust are very important for the way to Grundgesetz was written. But there is no connection made. The next paragraph does not make reference to this and mentions the necessity to keep history from repeating itself in a much more neutral way. Later on:\\r\\nAny war could and should be categorised as an \"\"atrocity\"\" but the war that Nazi Germany started brought a scale of atrocity never previously known and the statistics of World War II clearly qualify it, by far, as the most heinous atrocity in all recorded history....\\r\\nUnverified claim, clearly anti-German. The figures I heard suggest that both Stalin and Mao had a higher death toll than Nazi-Germany. Correct, most of their dead were in their own country, but I do not see how that would make it any better.\\r\\n...and created thereby in Germany the legal situation within which any association of persons that, by reason of their aims or the behaviour of their members or adherents, seek to undermine or abolish this constitutional order is simply illegal, and which assigns to all Germans the absolute right and duty** to resist any person seeking to undermine or abolish this constitutional order, because this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of the 62 million casualties which brought the outbreak of the racial fanaticism in Hitler’s Germany.\\r\\nWhile it is unclear where this text comes from, it does not seem to be a quote. I do not believe that this demand makes on the entire German people the memory of 62 million casualties is something that should be claimed in Wikipedia if it is not a direct or indirect quote of some political, moral or other authority. There is also context missing the the right and duty to resist. Violence by the people is only intended as a last resort and is illegal if there is functional police or military loyal to the consitution to deal with the situation.\\r\\nDirectly below the list with senseless emphasis, there is the claim that the German consitution contains blasphemy. Huh? The preamble contains a direct reference to god, other than that there is a rule that religion and state must not interfere in each others buisiness. I am not seeing any blasphemy there. At that time, Germany was a fairly religious state. To sum it up: I believe there was some editor here that wanted to make modern Germany look bad by applying non neutral wording and some unverified claims. The german version of this article seems much better and (logically) is checked much more often than this one. I suggest either having someone who not only read the whole Grundgesetz, but also has significant political and historical knowlege check this article for further inaccuracies or using the german version, which I believe is often checked by people who know the subject, to check this one through. There should be sources to every claim and despite the atrocities in the third reich, wording should be neutral and the crimes of the Nazis should only be mentioned in a context where it makes sense.

Humans share 98% of our genetic code with Chimpanzees, yet that 2% defines our differences and is important as is the difference in the human population, no matter how small the difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are obviously differences in the expressed traits between Asian, African and Caucasian. These are different types of humans, if you choose to call the a race/breed or type it\\'s up to you and it\\'s immaterial. My argument has always been that racial diversity should be preserved which is a more neutral position rather than promoting that race mixing and interbreeding is somehow positive.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou and many people that listen to pop culture may think that by interbreeding you are helping humanity and there are lots of myths about how you will create better offspring; offspring that have the best of both parents. This is just a myth told by people who, are trying to say that people are equal, if different. Yes, people are people as Americans we believe that all people have certain inalienable rights but the best position for humanity is for each of the races to exist, separately to be the best we can. If you truly understand the advantages that diversity offers you will agree too.\\r\\n\\r\\nI personally breed horses. And this is where I\\'ll start telling you a story: the Thoroughbred horse started out as a mixed race horse. It was based on Arab stock and was bred only for speed for many generations, regardless of breed, the horse that ran the race the fastest was bred to other fast horses. The Thoroughbred breeding book is now closed, which means you cannot breed a Thoroughbred to any other breed, because, ANY cross you make outside of the gene pool will reduce the speed of the horse. This is called line breeding, please read this article as a basic \"\"learn to breed\"\" guideline: http://www.learntobreed.com/linebreeding.html. Line breeding(inbreeding) is a useful technique as is outcrossing when advantagous to produce quality results, random mixing is like a child finger-painting and does nothing positive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat Wikipedia has been proposing is that random interbreeding is potentially a good idea and should be treated as potentially positive. Any person who knows about breeding animals will disagree, it\\'s very unlikely that race mixing will result in a positive result unless it was planned for by a geneticist. When you cited the plant hybridization, that\\'s what you were doing citing a hybrid that was designed in a laboratory and there were not human beings or living animals as a result of a genetic mistake.

I\\'ll post some specific ones on the talk page but more generally:\\r\\n\\r\\n Please don\\'t take it the wrong way but I think quite often your writing style reflects academia too much - as if you were writing for an academic journal. However the intended target audience of the Wikipedia is different than that of a bunch of academics so care should be taken to avoid unnecessary nomenclature and jargon, as well as to avoid \"\"academic phrasing\"\" in favor of simple formulations. More importantly I think one should be careful with introducing terms and concepts into the text that have not been defined previously and that a lay reader may be unfamiliar with, for example \"\"social cost\"\" or \"\"social production\"\".\\r\\n Speaking of \"\"social production\"\" it\\'d be useful to standardize the terminology when it is being used. For example it seems like by \"\"proportions of social production\"\" you refer to income shares of various classes (workers, capitalists, landlords etc) - if so, then that should be stated clearly, if not, the difference should be clarified. Likewise comparing the article title and the lead I think you\\'re equivocating between \"\"economic worth\"\" and \"\"social worth\"\" which could be/are distinct concepts. Also because I\\'m probably coming at this from a different background I\\'m wondering what exactly is the relationship between \"\"social product\"\" and more standard measures of production like GDP, income, etc.\\r\\n \"\"Both contemporary and historical wage price series are inherently controversial, as they speak to the standard of living of working class people.\"\" - I\\'m not sure if contemporary wage and price series are really \"\"inherently\"\" controversial in the sense of being outright rejected by many researchers; at least that doesn\\'t seem like the appropriate word here. Likewise, I don\\'t think the reason why they are controversial/deemed important is because they concern \"\"working class people\"\". They obviously concern all members of society whatever their class status. In a similar way the idea of \"\"economic worth\"\" can refer to entities such as firms, charities, nations or even physical objects such as machinery and equipment.\\r\\n Proportion of gdp and the questions given as examples aren\\'t really related. For example the question \"\"what was the opportunity cost of a £50,000 investment in 1840?\"\" is not obviously or directly related to the question \"\"what was the social power of capital in 1840?\"\".\\r\\n Some ideas for expansion: \"\"Theoretical problems\"\" sections should link and perhaps briefly mention things like the LTV and marginalism, maybe something like the aggregation problem (though that article needs some serious work). \"\"Wage price series\"\" can be expanded to include discussion of how these kind of data are generally collected (btw, I\\'m not sure what a \"\"real price\"\" is here. An individual good price divided by a price index?). For historical wage price series there\\'s also a good bit of data available for the Netherlands and to a lesser extent France and Germany. There\\'s also sporadic data for a wide number of different societies which don\\'t really constitute a series but do provide \"\"snapshot\"\" views of the economy/society in time (all the way back to ancient Sumer). The main difficulty of comparing aggregates across time is the changing nature of a consumption basket and time usage, in particular introduction of new goods and disappearance of old ones (like Malleus alludes to above) - this should also be elaborated upon and made more explicit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'d really hate to barge in and edit a new article while it is still being written so I thought bringing up some suggestions here would be better.

Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God\\'s love is sometimes described as a \"\"river of fire\"\". Hence both God\\'s goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person\\'s free will.\\r\\n * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death\\'s power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that\\'s not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed.\\r\\n * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not.\\r\\n Hope this helps.

In the UK, people often enquire about nationality not knowing themselves exactly what the Hell they mean; ask me, I\\'ve been there thousands of times.

There are atleast four other strands of nationality which are not citizenship; whoever acquires what is down to the circumstances. Finally, if as you say, the English language nationality means legal status, why apply it to a politician? Where is the sense in a Swedish citizen/national running affairs in Malta?

You may have noticed that some of the mottos recently have been followed by a date from 2006, or on occasion simply \"\"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\"\". The reason for this is that Motto of the day is in some very serious need of help. Participation in the project, which has never been especially high, has dropped considerably over this past summer, to the point we have had several days where no motto was scheduled to appear at all. Over the past several weeks, I\\'ve been the only editor scheduling mottos at all, but there aren\\'t enough comments on some of these mottos to justify their use. If we do not get some help - and soon - your daily mottos will stop. In order for us to continue updating these templates for you, we need your help.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you get a chance between your normal editing, could you stop by our nominations page and leave a few comments on some of the mottos there, especially those that do not have any comments yet? This works very simply; you read a motto, decide whether or not you like it, and post your opinion just below the motto. That\\'s it - no experience required, just an idea of what you personally like and what you feel reflects Wikipedia and its community. If you do have past experience with the project, then please close some of the older nominations once they\\'ve got a decent consensus going. There are directions on the nominations page on how to do this.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have any questions, please let me know, or post on the project\\'s talk page.

I recently found the mentioned portal after it was placed in the related portals section of the dino portal. I checked it out & saw it had a number of problems which were in violation of the fair use policy among others. Firstly, none of the pictures on the portal (all of which are fair use) have fair use rationale. I expressed this to the user (User:Cuddly Panda) who has been the sole contributor of the portal with no reply. On closer inspection, it seems the user has been uploading & adding fair use images to wikipedia for some time now, possibly upwards of a year, & despite numerous warning from automated bots etc, has now seemed to learn from this or the links provided or ceased their image infringements. Just check out the user\\'s talk page - nearly every message is a message about the misuse of uploads. In addition to this, the portal is very poor in quality, unmaintained and relies heavily on unfree images and poor portal sections (some of which have already been nominated for deletion).

There\\'s a few options:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) Obviously the user is not listening to warnings & my messages, so could I possibly bring this up at the administrator\\'s noticeboard? They could then decide what to do next.\\r\\n2) Since sections of the JP Portal are being nomianted for deletion already, I could potentially nominate the whole portal at MfD with a vote of \"\"no opinion\"\". This would see what other editors think of the portal & even if it is kept, the portal\\'s fair use pictures problem would still be sorted out by the end of the nomiantion.\\r\\n3) I\\'ll probably do this anyway, but the user is on Editor Review & I could also place a note there explaining what the user is doing wrong & how to remedy this.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, I\\'d personally like to do all three, but if you can think of something else & help me decide which of those, if any, to carry out, it would be appreciated.

Briefly, I just felt that it was a bad example because (in my view) it both overestimated the impact of Wynton's recording, and underestimated how popular and well-known the concerto already was before Wynton was even heard of. It seems to give a status to that one recording which is not due (I speak as a trumpet player who very much admires Wynton as a player, but is very suspicious of the hype which sometimes attends him) and which seems to ignore the many fine recordings of this piece which have been made before and after that one. It's not a situation like Gorecki 3 or the loathsome The Piano. It just, from where I am sitting, entirely lacks the feeling of a crossover. It's just one good recording, among many, of a very popular piece.

Some initial responses: \\r\\n I don\\'t think \"\"Ukraine in WWI\"\" is suitable, because most of the activity discussed in the article wasn\\'t directly concerned with the war, and the period covered doesn\\'t correspond to the duration of WWI (1914–1918). \\r\\n \"\"Ukraine after the collapse of the Russian Empire\"\" would be better, but it only defines the period in question by what it followed. In contrast, \"\"in the Russian Revolution\"\" is associated with the events covered herein.\\r\\n I agree that \"\"History of Ukraine (1917-1922)\"\" is the most neutral, but that is simply because it avoids saying what the article is about. I think readers appreciate being given a clue to the subject of an article when they see the title in isolation.  It would also be good to have a title which can at least occasionally be linked directly, rather than always having to type a piped link: [[History of Ukraine (1917-1922) |Ukraine in the Russian Revolution]].\\r\\n\\r\\n The first revolution of 1917 is what starts the events here, and Russian Revolution or Russian Civil War can refer to the greater events up to 1921.  I also think this article requires an earlier section covering events from the 1905 Revolution, but that will take a bit of reading first.\\r\\n\\r\\n Is it a problem to associate a Ukrainian history article with the Russian revolution in the title?  Personally, I think it\\'s neutral because it doesn\\'t imply that Ukraine was Russian, but merely refers to the defunct Russian Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\n But as I wrote above, you make some good points.

One of the major issues was nullification (the idea that states could 'nullify' or veto congressional legislation). Calhoun refused to run with Jackson for this reason, and South Carolina entered a brief anti-Democratic phase. Calhoun resigned as VP, the first person to do that, and became an anti-administration U.S. Senator. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. Another major issue was the National Bank. Clay forced a vote on extending the charter of the Bank in the summer of 1832. Jackson vetoed it. Clay felt that the Bank would be critical to economic development.

The effort combines traditional and Internet-based fundraising appeals with the additional benefits of community organization and potential significant free mass media coverage reporting the candidate\\'s notable success, if any.\\r\\nThe term was used as early as 2004, but came to prominence in Fall 2007 in reference to the 2008 Ron Paul presidential campaign in the United States, with its record-breaking fundraiser of November 5. The term has also been applied to other 2008 presidential candidates.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrigin\\r\\nAccording to The Politico, the term was coined in 2007. The chosen fundraiser date for the Paul campaign in 2007 was November 5th, Guy Fawkes Day. This commemorated a time in 1605 when the English revolutionary Guy Fawkes was captured in an attempt to destroy the British Parliament building with 36 barrels of gunpowder. The Guy Fawkes event had also been popularized by a 2006 film, V for Vendetta, which depicted a modern-day fascist Parliament, overpowered by popular revolution that was led by \"\"V\"\", a Fawkes-like character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2007 moneybomb was the largest documented one-day online fundraiser in political history, bringing in over $4 million. On November 6, Ron Paul\\'s campaign stated that in addition, the free media coverage after the event was worth well over $10 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe imagery of Guy Fawkes and its redefinition in the film V for Vendetta has been challenged, since Parliament in 1605 was a constitutional system, but in the 2006 film it had become the symbol of misguided government, so the picture of rejecting such a government was ambiguous.

Let me explain why I think it should have its own section. This page is called \"\"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident,\"\" not \\'\\'Tiananmen Square self-immolation hoax\"\", or \"\"Tiananmen Square staged self-immolation.\"\" That is correct, but at the same time it is the same name that would be used if they were confirmed Falun Gong members. Since the nature of the incident is so crucial to defining the story, and that by default the \\'argument\\' of the piece—that is, the entire way in which the story is known to the world—is through the claim that the individuals were Falun Gong practitioners. There would be no such thing as the \"\"\"\"Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident\"\" if it were not claimed that they were Falun Gong members.  In this situation, making clear that there is a well-founded counter narrative is important. It\\'s not something to stuff away to a side-box or the corner of the article. It should not dominate the page, but it should be as prominent as the other narrative (or more so depending on the evidence and wp:due)—therefore I think placing all of that information in its own section is quite appropriate. The other speculations and disputations about the identity of the people and so forth (the parts that are not strictly evidence-based) are separate to this arc.

Calling it An Unearthly Child will not only help these \"\"newbies\"\", but also seeth the feelings of quite a lot of Whovians I know. (As well as this, at least half of the sources I have seen - official or otherwise - call it \"\"An Unearthly Child\"\").  20:39, 9 January 2006\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current opener to the article and the redirects handle the requirements anyway. Fandom has long been deeply divided and I don\\'t think some notion of appeasing one wing of the debate should direct where the Wikipedia page is located.   \\r\\n I agree. As long as the proper redirects are in place and the article acknowledges the alternate titles, I think we\\'re good. This isn\\'t quite the same situation we had with the TV movie when an off-the-cuff remark by the producer calling it Enemy Within came to be seen as somehow official. (And the Doctor Who Information Network here in Canada apparently uses a different title altogether that was mentioned in a CBC profile of the series made to tie in with the Eccleston season. I forget the name that was used.).  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe CBC profile I think used \"\"Out of the Ashes\"\", which apparently came from a misreading of Shannon Patrick Sullivan\\'s webpage.  As for 100,000 BC vs. An Unearthly Child, I agree that the redirects and article opening make the issue less pressing, but I also think that the title used in the DVD release (which isn\\'t just in the US, but UK as well) lends a bit more weight to the An Unearthly Child argument.  However, if we do reconsider the page\\'s location, I agree that it shouldn\\'t be about appeasing one group or another, but what\\'s best for the article.  — (talk • contribs) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe DVD releases seal it for me - these should both be at their DVD titles, with the others being redirects.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s a good point to raise. I personally believe that it should be An Unearthly Child; but then it\\'s not up to me, and I fully understand where Josiah is coming from. Why don\\'t we settle this once and for all: a democratic vote where Whovians like ourselves vote for one title or the other. Anyone else agree/have another idea?   16:18, 11 January 2006\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ll put my vote in as An Unearthly Child also.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s been said before, but I\\'ll say it again. The title of the serial is 100,000 BC. The title of the first episode is \"\"An Unearthly Child\"\". The fact that BBC Enterprises releases the DVD as \"\"An Unearthly Child\"\" is a matter of marketing, not historicity, and neither here nor there. The real reason the serial was called An Unearthly Child to begin with was because of a mistake by the Radio Times. AUC redirects to the right page, and there\\'s no confusion. I\\'d rather rename The Daleks to The Mutants rather than change 100,000 BC to that.

We could say that the MRM is a countermovement to feminism, a reaction to feminism, a response to feminism, a rebellion against feminism, etc. And, by the way, were we addressing the subject of AIDS, we also wouldn\\'t say \"\"It is considered to be a caused by the HIV virus\"\" would we? Rather, we would say that \"\"AIDS is caused by the HIV virus\"\" or, to more explicitly bring in outside authority, \"\"AIDS has been determined to be caused by the HIV virus.\"\" That\\'s because \"\"is considered to be\"\" also brings in a degree of subjectivity to the statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour second example is closer to our situation and, to be honest, it isn\\'t all that obviously unacceptable to me.

Moreover, unlike Holocaust denial, standard issue MRM causes don\\'t reflect a flat-out denial of historical fact.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat I see in the present \"\"It is considered to be a backlash to the feminist movement\"\" wording, are editors taking the most negative description of the movement that they could \"\"get away with\"\"  (saving the even less acceptable \"\"misogynist\"\" for a segment of the movement later in the lead) and then framing it in the least subjective manner that they could \"\"get away with\"\": \"\"It is considered to be\"\".

The reason I find it necessary to do this is because some elements of Chang\\'s story, which report claims of the DI have been blithely elevated to facthood, without benefit of a critical examination of the reported claims.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is my initial draft for the new section, to appear below the biography and above the discussion of the controversial DI petition.\\r\\n\\r\\nControversial New York Times Story\\r\\n\\r\\nIn February 2006, the New York Times ran an investigative story Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition by Kenneth Chang of the New York Times Science Desk, reporting that the Discovery Institute had launched a new websiteDissent From Darwin to promote their expanded public relations campaign regarding how theories of evolution should be taught in public school.  The new website included a list of signatories to an earlier petition which the Discovery Institute had termed \"\"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.\"\"Signatories of \\'A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism\\' The petition dated back to 2001 when it was first published by the Discovery Institute beneath an ad criticizing a forthcoming PBS series on evolution.2001 \"\"100 Scientists\"\" Ad]  The headline on the Discovery Institute\\'s 2001 ad was also \"\"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,\"\" although the petition itself, embedded at the bottom of the ad, did not carry that label (it bore no label at all).  The untitled 2001 version of the petition simply read, \"\"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\"\" \\r\\n\\r\\nChang\\'s story disclosed that Professor Picard\\'s name appeared on the petition cited by the newly launched Dissent From Darwin website, but the Times article did not distinguish which version she signed.  Indeed, Professor Picard\\'s name first appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition and her name remained on the subsequent controversially yclept versions, including the most recent one appearing on the new website.  Chang\\'s story neither substantiated nor refuted the claims of the Discovery Institute that the two-sentence petition supported or endorsed DI\\'s slant on its meaning, but the story did include a mixture of quotes from some of the people whose names appeared on the list at different times, including some quotes that cast doubt on the Discovery Institute\\'s characterization of all the petition signers as variously \"\"dissenters from Darwinism\"\" or \"\"anti-evolution.\"\"  Chang\\'s story, in conjunction with the Discovery Institute\\'s website and its attached list of petition signers left a wake of confusion over who among the list of signers of the earlier versions of the petition agreed with or consented to the Discovery Institute\\'s characterization of the petition signers as \"\"anti-evolution\"\" \"\"dissenters\"\" who presumably supported the emerging and evolving agenda of the Discovery Institute.  It is at present unknown to what degree, if any, Picard agrees with or supports the Discovery Institute\\'s controversial interpretation of the petition as \"\"dissent.\"\"  It is also unknown whether Picard has ever supported any or all of the ongoing political agenda of the Discovery Institute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last two sentences of the proposed new section reflect the absence of verifiable published information regarding the attitude of most of the original 103 signers.  So far, Wikipedia has only managed to obtain a reliably sourced comment from Stanley N. Salthe, who disputed DI\\'s characterization and supplied his own salty attitude, \"\"A plague on both their houses.\"\"  \\r\\n\\r\\nSkip Evans of the NSCE similarly casts doubt on the DI\\'s interpretation, saying\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Statement\\r\\nThe signatories appear to attest to a statement about the ability of natural selection to \"\"account for the complexity of life\"\" - in other words, a statement about how evolution t', '\"\\r\\n\\r\\n Talk:Publicmind.com \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the middle of a discussion on gathering sources for the Publicmind.com stub-article, you erased the article.

They can be accused of hijacking Islam.[23]\\r\\nThe Wahabi movement is directly involved in terrorist activities all over the World.The Al Qaeda and a lot of recent Islamic terrorists such as Osama Bin Laden, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, and Abu Musab Al Zarqawi, have been inspired by Wahabism[24]. The regular Bombing of shrines in Pakistan and Killing of Sunnis and Shias is done by Sipah-e-Sahaba and TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan).[25] Wahabism is associated with the removal of head stones from the graves of the members of the family of the Prophet Muhammed, and the desecration of Islamic shrines in Hejaz and Karbala in Iraq, and the struggle for power in what was yet to become Saudi Arabia. Once its followers took power, they did whatever they could to destroy Ethiopia. For example, the secessionist war in Eritrea (1958-1991), which was designed to make Ethiopia land-locked, was largely financed by Saudi Arabia. Likewise, Saudi finance made it possible for Somalia to invade Ethiopia in 1977- 1978. The Saudi authorities may deny this, but it is widely documented. [26]\\r\\n[edit]In Pakistan\\r\\n\\r\\nThe JamatudDawah ,Lashkar-e-Jhangvi,Lashkar-e-Taiba and Sipah Sahaba are main terrorist organization of Wahabi movements .These terrorist organizations have been banned by Pakistani government but are working by their new names.

He did do this type of work in civilian life as stated in a newspaper article I have reporting on him and the incident in which he recieved the silver star.

My father mentioned a story about John C Shumate being in the Military MP's and in one incident taking a group of MP's to remove a bunch of squatters that had moved onto an old deserted military base. Have you heard of Richard Marcinko? He is the founder of Seal Team Six (Counter Terrorist) and Red Cell. Red Cell was a group of Navey Seals tasked with going to different Naval Bases to test security. They basically acted like terrorist, they tried to sneek onto Naval Bases, kidnap high ranking officials, plant explosive etc etc. The reason I mention this is because according to my Dad John C Shumate did this at some in the military.

As best as I can determine, the issues are 1) use of code share in lead & 2) changing tense \"\"is\"\" to \"\"was\"\" (based on this edit). In regards to Wikipedia:AVINAME, the guideline is the following (abridged for clarity): \\r\\n\"\"Where an aviation incident article...begins with the opening sentence: Airline Flight XYZ...., it should go on to immediately describe the notability of the incident in as few as words as possible. For this reason, it is not necessary in the opening line to clarify that the flight number may still be in use, or where it is normally scheduled to fly - this is because the normal flight or flight number is not the subject of the article...For example: Madeup Airway Flight 123 was a passenger flight from Somewhere to Somewhere Else, that on such and such a day, failed/crashed/blew up/was hijacked. [correct]\"\" \\r\\nI think the important part of the guideline is what I italicized. I think the code share is important, especially given the media coverage focusing on the men traveling on stolen passports. Whether or not that belongs in the lead doesn\\'t matter to me...it could be a separate sentence or mentioned in the \"\"incident\"\" section. Take a look at the example given in the guideline—Air Florida Flight 90—and the recent high-profile, highly-edited article Air France flight 447. Both use two sentences, first being to state the origin/destination and the second stating the aircraft & what happened. I don\\'t think there needs to be a reference to the men using stolen passports, as officials do not believe they have links to terrorism. It\\'s also difficult to write about the significance of the flight without referencing it as \"\"crashed\"\", per Wikipedia policies.

I will just question two points. First I am not sure what you have accomplished by suppressing the publishers\\' understanding of the Singapore Math method. You may disagree with them, but it is still valid in a Wikipedia article to report what the publisher believes about their own work. I actually agree with much of your evaluation, but in order to keep Wikipedia neutral, our opinions should not be used to decide what to report and what not to report. The publisher\\'s own description of their books should be included in this article. Perhaps you could write it in a way that makes it more clear that this is the publisher\\'s own (and perhaps biased) opinion?\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, if you suppress the reason why the National Math Panel believes Singapore Math to be exemplary, you should delete the entire reference to this fact. You may disagree with the Math Panel\\'s thinking, but the fact is that this (and Singapore\\'s success on international tests) is the only reason Singapore Math was cited in their report. By deleting what the Math Panel said leaves the reader under the impression that the Math Panel reviewed Singapore Math (they did not) and are in agreement with all of the features of Singapore Math. Their precise statement was, \"\"The Singapore standards (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2006) provide an established example of curriculum standards designed to develop proficiency in a relatively small number of important mathematics topics, as validated by a recent analysis (Ginsburg et al., 2005).\"\"\"', 'You currently appear to be engaged in an edit war.

Here's a re-working, re-inserting that:\\r\\n\\r\\nSustainability, in a very general sense, is the capacity to maintain a certain process or state indefinitely. However, over the last 50 years or so in recent years the concept has been applied more specifically to living organisms and systems, and to humanity in general. As applied to the human community, sustainability has been expressed as This is sometimes expressed through the idea of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSustainability requires that human activity only uses nature’s resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. The term has its roots in ecology as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain ecological processes, functions, biodiversity and productivity into the future. There is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably by consuming the Earth’s limited natural resources more rapidly than they are being replaced by nature. Consequently, for many people, sustainability has come to mean a call for action, for a collective human effort to keep human use of natural resources within the Earth’s finite resource limits.\\r\\n\\r\\nSustainability has become a controversial and complex all-purpose term  that is widely applied in many different ways: to different levels of biological organization (e.g.sustainable e.g.,wetlands, gardens, prairies, forests), to different levels of human organization (sustainable households, (e.g., ecovillages, eco-municipalities, sustainable cities) towns, sustainable countries) and to human activities and disciplines and more {e.g., (sustainable agriculture, sustainable architecture sustainable economics).\\r\\n\\r\\nI sure hope that this one passes muster for all.\", 'San Salvador crime section\\r\\nit is not fair for san salvador to have a crime section if san salvador is goin to have one then one should be put on all latin american countries because they all have crime and particularly nicaragua has crime extreme poverty and many corruption issues and in the MS section i have article that are reliable that state that mexicans guatemalans and nicaraguans are part of the MS13 as well. okay it is not fair for san salvador like i said i will defenetly work on putiing one in every single latin american country or you can just take the crime section off san salvador wich is the best thing to do because it is not right at all for san salvador to be the only one with a crime section. if one coutry has it they all need one.', \", 5 November 2007 (UTC)\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't think I'm the one most in need of a lecture about not seeing the forest for the trees.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook, Duk, if you want to take on the job of my reeducation, I can probably talk to you about it.  \\r\\n\\r\\nBut if you want to do so, first we need a solid foundation on which to build the discussions.

Do not delete peoples post because YOU think it doesn\\'t fit to YOUR standards, it\\'s for people to talk on.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that, I repost my statement to WHY Coheed and Cambria are not emo.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst off, I\\'d like to take the time to say. Read this, and don\\'t reply UNLESS you are agreeing, or are going to change this matter. If you are just going to sit there and whine because you are wrong about something, I don\\'t want to hear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo here we begin...\\r\\n\\r\\nEach song that Coheed and Cambria has made, has gone in flow with a comic that Claudio Shanchez (Lead Singer) has thought of in that brilliant mind of his. Some might claim some of the songs emo due to a few lyrics. Well, how else would you explain a painful moment, or happy moment in a story? A rhyme about whatever the heck \"\"junk in a trunk\"\" is? No, you\\'d have an explanation of the characters pain and happiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps you should read some stuff from wiki itself. \\r\\nWithin The Amory Wars page, (The comic made by Claudio)\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\"The story follows the adventure of Claudio Kilgannon across the fictional solar system, far in the past known as Heaven\\'s Fence, in an attempt to seek help from his Uncle, after his parents are tricked into murdering Claudio\\'s siblings, and then murdered themselves by the Supreme Tri-Mage and ruler of Heaven\\'s Fence, Wilhelm Ryan.\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of their songs came from a point in the story, if you had known the story, you\\'d not tag them as emo at all. Because in fact they are not, it\\'s a story. Get over it and stop with all of this \"\"scene\"\" stuff. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s all a story, unlike other bands that cry and scream about \"\"I want to die, no one understands me, I have it so bad, My girlfriend left me because I am whiny\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstand what I am pointing out?\\r\\n\\r\\nEmo is the most ridiculous label ever, yet sadly it is here and people wont let it die willingly. \\r\\nSo, why not research bands before you label. While you are at it, read the Coheed and Cambria comics, they are quite the epic.

It\\'s not difficult once you understand that sorting numerically isn\\'t possible because of BC in some of the years and commas in the casualty figures.  All we are doing here is converting those numbers into an alphabetic format that the table can sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nSorting for casualties, zero padding is necessary if we are going to use comma separators\\r\\nCCCC represents the casualty number\\r\\nUse:{{formatnum:{{padleft:CCCC|7|0}}}} \\r\\nExample: {{formatnum:{{padleft:300000|7|0}}}} produces 0,300,000\\r\\nIn case of a range, like (5,000-10,000), only the first number needs to use the formatnum template to make it sortable.\\r\\nThe use of the tilde \\'~\\' destroys the sort order.  I don\\'t think it\\'s really necessary since almost all of these numbers are approximate anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make years sortable we have to insert invisible characters before the actual values.\\r\\nTo do this, we use  anything here is invisible\\r\\n YYYY represents the year\\r\\nFor years BC:\\r\\nUse: !{{#expr: 9999 - YYYY}} YYYY BC\\r\\nExample: 846 BC becomes !{{#expr: 9999 - 846}} 846 BC\\r\\nNote the space just before the . It is necessary!\\r\\nFor years AD:\\r\\nWe pad left N number of zeros to make the year 4 digits\\r\\nUse: #NYYYY\\r\\nExample: 3 becomes #0003\\r\\nExample: 34 becomes #0034\\r\\nExample: 345 becomes #0345\\r\\nExample: 1456 becomes #1456\\r\\nNote there is no space before and after the .

When the wavefront has power levels distributed at different frequencies so that some parts the spectrum have more or less power, then we call that a color.

It is just one wavefront but shaped in power intensity vs frequency. There is no such thing as different colors of light waves, only a wavefront that has a power vs frequency shape. As such there are not incoming different frequencies of light to produce a color, its just one wavefront. No separate blue or red light enters the eye to be combined and produce a color.

I am in fact the author of The Whole World Calendar Book of Holidays Around the World, as stated (an as-yet unpublished book which is based upon the self-published The Whole World Calendar 2008 [and 2009; email me at wholeworldcalendar@gmail.com and I’ll be glad to send you a sample page and info on ordering, if interested]). I have sent Wikipedia its permissions grant for using copyrighted material as requested and assure you that I am not self-promoting. My mistake is in not yet spending the time to figure out exactly how to cite the book as the reference for the article, which I’ll do as soon as I have the time. My intent in adding the articles is that they are actual national/religious/cultural holidays and festivals, are therefore ‘newsworthy’ if not particularly important, and, having spent two years researching the topic, I can assure you that it is quite difficult at times to find such information  try to find out what Earthquake Victims Memorial Day is in Armenia and you’ll see what I mean. It is my intent to self-publish the book within 6 months if I cannot find a publisher. Meanwhile, feel free to delete my articles as desired. I’ll revisit the subject at a later date and repost them only after I’ve ascertained that I am, in fact, doing it right. Meanwhile, I’m not copying from somebody else  those articles are my own  that’s the way I write. Thanks much.   Chris Corbett-Fiacco', \"WP:WEB\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't know what you mean by jumping to conclusions, but noted nonetheless. To address your example directly, Dominic Deegan was actually printed, published, and released, which gives it a  bit of a foothold in the webcomic world. It has tens of thousands of Google hits, the first several hundred of which are unique and relevant, and several hundred unique sites also link to it. It also gets a couple million views per month according to Alexa.com. The three methods on their own are not always the best for rating the notability of a subject, but when combined, they give a clearer picture\\r\\n\\r\\nSome articles are marked for deletion soon after creation, and others aren't marked until several months (or years) after their first edit. However, in the end, they will eventually receive the same scrutiny all other articles must undergo- an unencyclopedic article will not be allowed to exist on the premise that other unencyclopedic articles already exist; they will, in all likelihood, be deleted eventually as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for WP:WEB itself: It's a guideline used to help determine the notability of the site. While the majority of sites that do not meet the criteria are deleted, all of those that do meet the criteria are kept. This criteria is an extension of the following policies:\\r\\n\\r\\n Wikipedia:Verifiability\\r\\n Wikipedia:Neutral point of view\\r\\n Wikipedia:No original research\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following guidelines:\\r\\n\\r\\n Wikipedia:Cite sources\\r\\n Wikipedia:Reliable sources\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the following tests:\\r\\n\\r\\n Wikipedia:Search engine test\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically, if the site has independent material published about it, receives an award, or is distributed through a notable publisher, information about it can be verified and, most importantly, neutral. This avoids original research. This also allows us to cite reliable sources; Wikipedia is not a primary source or publisher of original research/information.

Should I need more, no problem just advise me. As far as I can see I did broadly meet the Notability standards. This may not be in the GA format that you are looking for, but as Wikipedia content relies on volunteers passionate about their article subject, I feel you should be more supportive. As I confirmed above it was me who asked for the reassessment, only at that stage, a few days ago, did you offer to \\'help\\' improve my article. The new article you created in your Sandbox, then only remains there for 1 day before you either lose the content or publish it - hardly enough time for me to discuss my objections about your new proposal to remove my article. To replace my article when you have not even finished reading Tunnels is ridiculous - surely any author on Wikipedia should at least have read the novel first, not sure how that can meet your verifiable Notability standards! That aside I have already correctly embarrassing errors concerning incorrect publishing dates and versions, wrong character and place names like Stynx and Hightail (not a one off). Others that come to mind include: The official publication date for the US Tunnels was January 2008 - it might have been that copies were available on Amazon earlier than that date, but that often happens in the UK and US. Nearly all territories have gone on to publish Deeper, and only a handful haven\\'t yet published Freefall (mainly due to their own financial difficulties, and not because the performance of the series hasn\\'t merited it!) - you can check this on the publishers website http://www.doublecluck.com/rights. The authors changed the title with Barry Cunningham - this article makes it sound as though he did it off his own back! There are two versions of the audiobook in the UK (the Davenport one is abridged), and also the American and German unabridged versions. Chester isn\\'t \"\"about to killed\"\" under SETTING - he is sentenced to go into the Interior! The Plot emphasis is all wrong and does not give a true insight into the overall storyline. The Setting and Plot areas you have changed are so badly written - and I am well aware of my own average writing abilities, but in comparison this new version lacks significant maturity. References to the Highfield Mole are confusing. Barry is now Barry Cunningham OBE, and there\\'s no question that he signed JK Rowling for her first two Harry Potter books whilst he was employed by Bloomsbury. I would like my article reinstated and with your expert help and support I would like to improve and expand my sources, and thus improve my own knowledge of Wikipedia article standards.

My advice to new editors is that it is best to start by making small improvements to existing articles, rather than creating new articles. That way any mistakes you make (which you will, because we all do) will be small ones, and you won\\'t have the discouraging experience of repeatedly seeing hours of work deleted. Gradually, you will get to learn how Wikipedia works, and after a while you will know enough about what is acceptable to be able to write whole new articles without fear that they will be deleted. Over the years I have found that editors who start by making small changes to existing articles and work up from there have a far better chance of having a successful time here than those who jump right into creating new articles from the start.

I don't know who quackguru is but I have a feeling from the name that there is at least a hint of bias.  The article by Ernst is the only article (with multiple flaws) that I know that has ever even stated that the risk by far outweighs the benefits.  Most of the articles I have seen state that manipulation (which is only one part of chiropractic) is at least as effective and most conclude that manipulation used with a multimodal approach such as with exercise therapy has a synergistic effect and is by far safer than OTC meds, NSAID's and prescription medications in the long term.  Think about it, less than 30 deaths after billions of treatments over 100 years is surely considered extremely safe.  I contacted the American Chriopractic Association.  They stated that they have already tried to provide information about scope of practice to Wikipedia but they are having troubles with posting to the page also.  If there is ever a source that should be considered respectable to Wikipedia, it should be the American Chiropractic Association (the chiropractic equivalent to the American Medical Association).  Please let me know what I need to do to get the more positive and consistent research to post to this page.  I am a little suprised at how difficult this is.  I have peer reviewed medical research and the American Chiropractic Association trying to provide proof that the information I presented was accurate.  I am not sure what else I can do.

And the statute that authorizes \"\"Federal Reserve Notes\"\", Section 411 of Title 12 of the United States Code, is also referenced in that section. Those references are correct and they are where they should be. Please do not confuse bills of credit (e.g., United States currency notes) with money (United States dollars). Please do not confuse bank-issued promissory notes (e.g., Federal Reserve Notes) with money (United States dollars).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress \"\"To coin money\"\" and Congress has authorized the coining (minting) of United States dollars. The Constitution also authorized Congress to borrow money, and Congress done that by authorizing the issuance of bills of credit known as United States currency notes. Those notes represent debts payable in United States dollars. Similarly, Federal Reserve Notes are issued by the twelve Federal Reserve Banks and those notes are, by statute, redeemable in United States dollars. \\r\\n\\r\\nEach Federal Reserve Note identifies the issuing bank by the first character in the note\\'s serial number. For example, the letter \"\"A\"\" represents the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. A complete list (A through L) can be found in Federal Reserve Bank. The Organization Cetificate of each Federal Reserve Bank is on file in the office of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency. Each certificate lists the names of the private banks that own and control the Federal Reserve Bank named in the certificate.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnited States Notes and Federal Reserve Notes are not United States dollars.  Those notes are evidences of indebtedness, not \"\"money\"\" as the word money is used in the U.S. Constitution.

After editing the page on Irreducible complexity to make it more neutral, my changes were reverted, and I received the following message from the aforementioned user:\\r\\n\\r\\nWelcome to Wikipedia, and thank you for your contributions. One of the core policies of Wikipedia is that articles should always be written from a neutral point of view. A contribution you made to Irreducible complexity appears to carry a non-neutral point of view, and your edit may have been changed or reverted to correct the problem. Please remember to observe this. Thank you. ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community. To say that only \"\"some\"\" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science SÆdon \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m fairly new here to Wikipedia, but I understand the basic rules regarding article editing, particularly involving mandatory neutrality. I\\'m confident that none of my additions were non-neutral in any way which biased the article. They were criticisms of criticisms of irreducible complexity  precisely the sort of thing expected for a neutral, fair-and-balanced article on irreducible complexity. Surely neutrality requires that both arguments for and against controversial ideas be presented, no? What the actions of SÆdon and the other watchdogs of any article involving the Darwinian evolution vs. intelligent design controversy say is that only one side of the issue, theirs, deserves to be presented. This is textbook neutrality  exactly what Wikipedia strives to avoid.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice the non-neutrality in Saedon\\'s message:\\r\\n\\r\\nID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is an example of either dishonesty of ignorance on Saedon\\'s part. Intelligent design is one of the hottest topics in science today precisely because it is taken seriously by the so-called \"\"scientific community.\"\" They take it seriously because it\\'s a very powerful, evidence-based argument that poses a great threat to the current orthodoxy, Darwinian evolution. This is why Saedon and the like watch over any and all articles regarding this debate, making sure they remain heavily biased towards Darwinian evolution, while reverting both arguments for I.D. and criticisms of criticisms against I.D., as happened in my case.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo say that only \"\"some\"\" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science\\r\\n\\r\\nTo say that only \"\"some\"\" of the scientific community views I.D. as pseudoscience is a factual statement. While they may be in the minority, there are many members of the scientific community who agree wholeheartedly that I.D. is science. To close your eyes, shove your fingers in your ears, and pretend that these scientists do not exist  as Saedon has done  is intellectual dishonesty. To then permeate Wikipedia with that intellectual dishonesty is unacceptable. Notice, too, Saedon\\'s non-neutral opinion that intelligent design is theology, rather than science.\\r\\n\\r\\nI refute that claim.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m atheist regarding the Gods of any organized religion, and yet I fully accept the scientific-basis of intelligent design. It\\'s no more theological than is big bang cosmology, or even its counterpart, Darwinian evolution. While all three views may have (a)theistic implications, the argumentation and observation behind all three are strictly secular and scientific. For Saedon to baldly assert that intelligent design is theology, and use this bald assertion to further justify his non-neutrality, watchdog-like behavior is unacceptable.\\r\\n\\r\\nI expect this situation to be dealt with accordingly; fairly, without bias, and absent bald assertions and loaded claims that encourage, if not outright justify, that bias.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\\r\\n  \"', \"Talk pages are not typically deleted.

It appears that several arbs have asked for another proposal to be put forward, which I have done at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Workshop#Editing_restrictions_proposal; I don\\'t know if they are aware of this proposal or not. I have another issue, that being my indef block which was put on myself for a perceived legal threat. This has been mentioned at Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Proposed_decision#On_Russavia, and it has also been mentioned there and on the proposed decision case page, that WP:NLT should be dealt with as per that policy. I have dealt with on the PD talk page, and also on my talk page at User_talk:Russavia#Alleged_legal_threats_issued_by_myself_and_unblock_request, as per WP:NLT. It should be mentioned that my indef block was not as a result of any arbcom enforcement, nor as a result of a community supported ban, but as a result of the perceived legal threat. The indef ban was lifted so that I could participate in the Arbcom proceedings, but at that stage WP:NLT had not been dealt with to the satisfication of the blocking admin.? Anyway, I would like to seek some clarification from you at the clerk for this case, as to what I would need to do in order to have the indef block \"\"officially\"\" lifted, so to speak, so that I can return to editing within the confines of the topic ban handed down by Sandstein. Your advice is appreciated.  Dialogue \\r\\nGiven the Committee didn\\'t pass that temporary injunction, I\\'d suggest that you are still under the restrictions set down as part of the unblock-to-participate-in-the-RfAr. When the case closes, I expect the Committee will deal with your blocking/unblocking in some way in the final decision; depending on what the final decision is in this regard (there are an infinite number of possibilities), you/we can re-evaluate the best course of action at that point. \\r\\nThe only way to have the conditions on the unblock lifted before the final decision would be to appeal to the Community and get consensus to overturn the block; I doubt that this would be successful given the parallel arbitration proceedings, as most Wikipedians will likely say \"\"just see what ArbCom decides then play it from there\"\".\\r\\nMy $0.02. Regards,   \\r\\nThanks for your reply Daniel, its appreciated. As you can understand I am in a state of purgatory at the moment, not really knowing what may come, and whether the committee will indeed address this, as several arbs have already stated their opinion that cases of WP:NLT should be addressed by the community. Given that WP:DIGWUREN took some 3 months to reach a conclusion, and other cases can take longer, I would hate for this case to take that long only for committee to turn my indef block back to the community. As I am a content creation driven editor, you can probably understand that this is less like purgatory, and more like hell. Do you think it may be possible to seek clarification from the Committee if the issue of my indef block for WP:NLT will be dealt with by them, or not? If not, I would expect this would free me up to take the issue to the community via an avenue such as WP:AN in order to allow me to continue editing, under the confines of the topic ban imposed by another admin, with that perhaps being addressed by Arbcom (the topic ban). Sorry for being a pain in the arse, but hopefully you understand my predicament and hence why I think it would need clarification from the Committee, as to whether it will or won\\'t be addressed. As you are the clerk, might you be so kind as to seek clarification for me, if you don\\'t mind of course. Also, my apologies for bringing this to your talk page, as I am totally new to Arbcom proceedings (hoping this will be my one and only involvement in one), I am somewhat bamboozled at to where to ask for clarification on the case pages; it is a dog\\'s breakfast that is for sure.

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject\\'s importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"\"db\"\" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article\\'s talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Even if you can produce a reliable source for your claim that names are defined in terms of a type and a rank (a claim that is also made in the lead), you have a problem with neutrality; Monsch (2003), for example, argues that names do not have definitions.

Instead of following every rule, it is acceptable to use common sense as you go about editing. Being too wrapped up in rules can cause loss of perspective, so there are times when it is better to ignore a rule.

Similarly, just because something is not forbidden in a written document, or is even explicitly permitted, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a good idea in the given situation.

Before creating this article I first uploaded images and created categories that relate to this article on Wiki commons under this category \"\"Category:Kura (Japanese saddle)\"\" [Kura_(Japanese_saddle)], this was over one year ago. There has been no objections to the title on Wiki commons.  When I originally named this article I did read the article naming guidelines contained in Wikipedia:Article titles, here are a few quotes from the naming guidelines:(it is sometimes necessary to add distinguishing information, often in the form of a description in brackets after the name.), I did this,  (The choice of article titles should put the interests of readers before those of editors, and those of a general audience before those of specialists.) It seems to me that only a \"\"specialist\"\" would understand what type of saddle a \"\"kura\"\" was, so when I named this article I looked at the list of saddle articles which are now in the category \"\"Saddles by type\"\" and here were saddle articles with titles such as English saddle, Western saddle and Australian Stock Saddle. Looking at these other saddle article titles I decided that Kura (Japanese saddle) would be the best title for this article as anyone who looked at the other articles on saddles could easily and instantly identify what type of saddle the article was about, if I had named the article Kura (saddle) it would not be a descriptive as the other saddle articles and someone with no knowledge of the subject would have to actually click on the title to see what a \"\"Kura\"\" was, with the word \"\"Japanese\"\" added a reader could instantly identify what type of saddle a \"\"Kura\"\" was, much like a reader who saw Australian Stock Saddle, Western saddle or English saddle would have a good idea what that article was about.\\r\\nI have seen \"\"precision\"\" mentioned, I do not understand how having the title as Kura (Japanese saddle) compared to Kura (saddle) goes against any of the guidelines in the section labeled \"\"Precision and disambiguation\"\", WP:PRECISION, if I had named the article \"\"Kura (the saddle of Japan) I would understand but how does Kura (Japanese saddle) go against any naming guidelines, how different is Kura (Japanese saddle) than Australian Stock Saddle? The only difference is some brackets. Here is a quote \"\"Precision – Titles usually use names and terms that are precise (see below), but only as precise as necessary to identify the topic of the article unambiguously.\"\" WP:NAMINGCRITERIA, the title \"\"Kura (saddle) not \"\"precise\"\" as it does not actually identify what type of saddle this is to the \"\"general reader\"\", I would rather have the article named \"\"Japanese saddle\"\" than \"\"Kura (saddle) so that anyone will know instantly what type of saddle this article is about if it is necessary to change the articles title, at least the \"\"general reader\"\" would be able to know what the article is about without having to click on the title as they would with Kura (saddle).    \"', '(Illuminati)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should mention him being invoved with the illuminati.', '\"\\r\\n\\r\\n Precious again \\r\\n\\r\\nEditor retention\\r\\nThank you for quality contributions on difficult topics such as Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, for your work in editor retention, even in , for presenting facts \"\"in a neutral fashion, with compassion, understanding and a calm demeanor\"\", - you are an awesome Wikipedian!\\r\\n\\r\\n  \\r\\nTwo years ago, you were the 337th recipient of my Sky Prize,   \"', 'Okay.
